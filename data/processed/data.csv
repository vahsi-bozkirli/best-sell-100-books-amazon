the woman in me,unbelievably impressive. her torn life on paper.,murderess marbie,4,"i'm only a third way in. shipped lightening fast.the print quality of the book is very good. i like the rose and the purple foil, they captured her taste here and will look bomb on my bookshelf.as for the writing it's good. amazing, no. but they painted an incredible picture of her life. much better writing than i thought to be honest. i was expecting more scattered blurbs throughout the book but the way it's presented does honor her experience, and sounds like her up to an extent. now, i do think the ghost writer went verbose in some areas that were unnecessary which derailed her voice in my head but i imagine getting the whole picture would be difficult.i was hoping for a thicker book as she's been through a lot. so i am a bit disappointed at that but nevertheless it's an interesting read thus far.as for britney's life story. i have to say they were smart in starting with her lineage and she didn't hold back keeping her family accountable from the gate. good on her for having conviction.i suddenly found myself understanding little quirks, connecting the dots, certain things would suddenly click in my head. for example her british accent and her relationship with a lynchpin matriarch elder.very cool build up. laying the ground work for her future decisions by presenting us with complex childhood family dynamics really has me understanding her choices and quirks much better than i ever realized i needed to be deep in thought of.sometimes we judge from a place of pity or outsider perspective instead of compassion. now i see the soft gentle feminine side of her mindset that we knew when she was younger start to peek through the pages. it's that sweet part of her soul that she doesn't show much nowadays, for good reason of course as she's been deeply hurt and damaged by other's greed, but that delicate nature is part of why most of us were charmed by her. i hope she finds her way back one day.she's been through a lot and i found myself relating to things she'd been through, and feeling deeply saddened by her sense of insecurity in childhood. her insights correlate along with many of my own life experiences and traumas. i was taken aback by her growth in reflection, as one would believe anger would be the easy way to portray her story, not the case here, it's her appreciation for her past that has earned my deep respect beyond what i thought i had possessed prior to reading.her story with her brother was touching and softened my distain for his participation in the matter of handling her affairs. although i hope he is held accountable someday. it shows how loving and innocent she was and how grave a loss she has suffered, for it is those who are selfless that don't speak up only to suffer the most.such a contrast to the presentation of her character in the media. thus far this book is an excellent read!------ to be continued* i'm looking forward to reading through this book in it's entirety and will update when i'm done. one star for the writing not sounding like her in some places. i will change accordingly.",26-10-2023,1668009048,7,2,20.93,4.5,britney spears,2023,memoir,britney,spears,1,26,10,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,0

the woman in me,britney you are so invincible! you are an inspiration and helped motivate me to be strong like you.,jamie,5,"the media could not be loaded. i personally have been in the same exact situations as some of these in britney‚Äôs memoir. my son‚Äôs father illegally withheld my son from me for 72 days when i have primary physical custody and sole legal custody. the police won‚Äôt take a child from a parents care regardless of court order! the court system is a joke and didn‚Äôt help at all. i am an unemployed single mother, so i didn‚Äôt have a lawyer and no one in my family would help me because my parents don‚Äôt have that kind of money and my nana and pop passed away. (all i have) it wasn‚Äôt until i filed an emergency hearing after all my other petitions were denied, to finally be seen at court to get my son back. the father even then refused so eventually after educating myself online for 65 days and countless hours of research, i made a petition asking the judge for police to use force as necessary to ensure i get my son back this time. a little more than a week later the judge granted it. the pain, emotional turmoil, absolute defeat, despair, depression, anxiety, grief, guilt, helplessness, and being put down by everyone you thought was family and loved you. i didn‚Äôt do anything wrong either. i had my son 24/7 with no help from anyone, his whole 5 years of life. working side jobs taking care of an old woman and cleaning dirty toilets to provide what he needed. those sleepless nights crying wondering why this happened, what your child is thinking or being told, if he thinks he was abandoned when you‚Äôre showing up with police escorts and every day fighting to get your child back, but your son doesn‚Äôt know that! in my situation, that whole petty situation was over my jealous sister trying to get me kicked out to take my room (master bedroom, my sons bedroom, and a master bathroom) i spent $7,000 renovating (old neglected house) and the father not wanting to pay child support, so they ganged up on us to be vindictive at the stake of my sons emotional and mental well-being. ($170 every two weeks only visits dad 6-8 days a month depending on how many weeks are in the month) people are cruel! you are only as good as you are giving. once your hand closes, you will have no one! my son is still struggling 5 months later with the emotional turmoil from the trauma they caused him. he‚Äôs having outbursts in school because of the trauma! i still am also traumatized every time his visitation at his father comes. i worry i‚Äôll never see my child again, and yes sometimes it makes me want to hide him too! for anyone to judge you and your choices when you were literally helpless walking through the gates of hell and trembling with every step, taking every single low blow, and still not giving up. doing it all alone, no help! evil experiences almost always revolve around money and evil people! you are invincible! no one will ever understand until they walk in those shoes. don‚Äôt you ever underestimate your resilience and strength. you are strong, you are amazing, you are beautiful, you can do it! what those people did to you, that were supposed to love you but instead used you to profit off your hard work, prosperity, and dedication, i hope karma comes for them hard. i can not imagine the trauma you have been through, especially living under a microscope with hundreds of dangerous paparazzi men hungry for money and seeing your grief and pain, profiting off your downfall when you were on top of the world, chasing you and your children around with such disrespect and disregard to how that would affect your children and your emotional and mental health, is disgusting. you were put in fight or flight mode, given ptsd, betrayed, and locked up like a prisoner. while everyone took all of your money you worked hard for, building your empire for the family you always dreamed of creating. please stay strong, and keep fighting for your happiness. you deserve to live the life of your wildest dreams, you deserve to be the happy woman that got to enjoy doing what she loved! you deserve to do what you want when you want! you are worth it! you know who you are, what you‚Äôve done, and what you are capable of! now pick up that crown üëë queen of pop, scream you won‚Äôt give up, and win!ü§üüèª‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥üòò",01-11-2023,1668009048,18,2,20.93,4.5,britney spears,2023,memoir,britney,spears,1,1,11,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Negatif,0
the woman in me,"fast read, sad story",kmg,5,"i have been a fan of britney's music since the '00s. she is just a couple years older than me. i didn't love how she dressed or how sexy she was on the tv screen, because i felt like i was expected to look and act just like her - at the time. she definitely influenced fashion and hair and young women's actions. however, that is not entirely her fault.the paparazzi was insane around her. there were so many tabloids and photos taken of her throughout the years that by the time i reached age 17 or 18, i refused to purchase or even pick up a magazine while standing at the store checkout- in solidarity with britney. what they did to her was disgusting, invasive and abusive. it makes my skin crawl, just thinking about it.but, her music was fire. the mixture of dub step rhythms with her music was so fun and energetic. i still listen to it from time to time and dance.the book was written pretty simply. you can see that she has done some therapy and has gained some insight into her life, her history. she is trying to understand why she did the things she did and why she trusted those she trusted. the kinds of betrayals she has endured in the past two decades will need some serious cbt to re-write those neuropathways into a healthier train of thought.our society is still learning what entails ""abuse"" and what does not. i've definitely felt my share of emotional and psychological abuse. it hangs inside of your thoughts long after you've stopped being around those people. you must be constantly diligent to stop those negative thoughts toward yourself and to re-write what your mind says to you. you hear what your mind tells you way more often than you hear negative words from others. you are with you 100% of the time. there's nowhere to run. so, you need to become your own best friend.i hope this book was written by her and that she is receiving the payments from purchases. i hope that she wrote it and it was done with her consent. i find the timing of the release of this book crucial- but, maybe if i was released from ""prison"", i would run to publish my side of the story, too. i would have probably been writing in journals the entire time.i hope she heals. she seems to be on her way. i hope she simplifies her life and stops letting outsiders inside of her mind. the book was easy to read, doesn't get too deep into her psyche. it is very surface level. she is telling her story. it's not super deep or introspective or thought provoking in any particular way. i am definitely confused as to why the conservatorship was done in the first place, and then held for 13 years- but i was already informed about that before the book. i read the book in 2 and 1/2 hours.many times, i wished that she would tell more details of one story or other. but, so much of her life has been an invasion of privacy, that i understand maybe she doesn't want to allow more than just the surface level story out there. it's her choice.",25-10-2023,1668009048,4,2,20.93,4.5,britney spears,2023,memoir,britney,spears,1,25,10,2023,Autumn,4,Negatif,Pozitif,0
the woman in me,"buy it, it‚Äôs worth the read!",stephanie brown,5,"whether or not you‚Äôre a fan, it‚Äôs a great read. britney takes you in her world and shares her perspective of how hateful the tabloid, tv hosts, and paparazzi was, and still is, to her. the vile, hateful, ignorant comments towards her that people got away with in the 2000‚Äôs is incomprehensible really. all the while she stood tall taking every blow and silently suffered through it. she was always perceived as dumb but i never thought that, she carried herself with dignity and gave everyone respect even if they didn‚Äôt reciprocate it. from what i‚Äôve gathered by reading her words, she didn‚Äôt have a enough people in her corner looking out for her. the struggles she shared about motherhood i felt so connected to, it‚Äôs difficult enough experiencing it in the comfort of your own home with people who love you and care about you, but to experience that all while the world was watching and scrutinizing everything you do seems agonizing. society still sets impossible standards for women and mothers. but men can do something as simple as take their kids to school and be sung as heroes. the judgment you feel amongst your own community of fellow parents is hard and can really make you second guess yourself as a parent, but on the scale of a celebrity, it seems impossible to do any good or anything right. i can‚Äôt ever imagine putting my kid through any of the horrible experiences her own family put her through. but not everyone is fit to be a parent, and from what i‚Äôve read her parents fit that mold very well. overall it is an exceptionally well written book and full of quirky humor that sheds a warm light on the britney i grew up watching, loving, and admiring. her strength and grit is unmatched. i hope this gives her solace and she thrives from this point on to find herself.",01-11-2023,1668009048,6,2,20.93,4.5,britney spears,2023,memoir,britney,spears,1,1,11,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,0
the woman in me,a must-read for anyone who's seeking freedom or overcoming imposter syndrome,leanne s.,5,"i had to finish the book in a week, because i needed breaks. although it's a quick-read - it reads lyrical, like her music, very catchy and vivid, it's dark, like the color of the cover.if everything stated in the memoir is true, shouldn't her father and his posse be arrested, or at least sued for fraud or abuse?is it just me or do her parents resemble jefferey epstein and ghislane maxwell who kept britney as a ""sex slave"" for 13 years, just to use her body to create cash flow?why is it when she's flying solo the families fell apart (parents divorced, sister tried to disown them), and when she's under conservatorship her family got reunited (parents got back together, watching criminal minds every night; and sister and father bonded).when she became an icon, she became a ""thing"" people would judge or vent on. she never had a life, and because of that, her growth, or womanhood, was stunted. she talked about what meant ""everything"" to her, music, family, sons..., it's saddening to learn that, in the end, the simple desires of having ""everything"" almost killed her. it became worse when she had no one to help. or maybe people were just preoccupied with their own struggles, as always.among her ordeal, she noted people she drew inspirations from, madonna, j.lo, reese witherspoon..., and the ""woman"" in her that had been suppressed for decades.that's what happened. not fair and horrific. her kind soul and eager for happiness eventually set her free from imprisonment. hope she will make up and catch up with life.",06-11-2023,1668009048,11,2,20.93,4.5,britney spears,2023,memoir,britney,spears,1,6,11,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,0
the woman in me,our queen has spoken!,kayce,5,"the world has had access to britney spears' memoir for one week and bookstagram is flooded with opinions and reviews. but since this is the latest kayce 5 star i have to tell you why and leave you my full review:i've been a britney fan since day one and have seen the relentless paparazzi coverage of her for 20 years. everyone has an opinion on britney, judge her and think they know everything based on what they've seen in magazines and online. finally speaking for herself, this memoir tells us about all those stories we think we knew but from her perspective.while the memes and reels about justin are pretty funny since this came out, britney went through a very traumatic experience with him (you know the one) and our girl held that in for twenty years. and why wouldn't she? that's an incredibly personal decision and all the while, the media villainized her and praised him. i really don't care what justin thinks about britney's revelations. he made his choices then and she's making her choices now. never once does she victimize herself but simply tells us how she felt through all the ups and downs. personally and professionally.you get fun stories too about her favorite album, favorite performances, celebs she admires and more. britney admits she is not good at fame (girl, we know and none of us would be either). if britney never gets on another stage for the rest of her life i wouldn't blame her for one second. but given how healing music is for her, i wouldn't be surprised if we got more music one day. and if it's on her terms i bet it will be the best she's ever released.since the woman in me is just 275 pages i thought it would feel short and unfinished but she did a great job recapping up to present day. she's so brave and stronger than she realizes and her love for her sons is on every page. cheers to britney, may she continue to heal and surround herself with people who love her and don't want to use or exploit her. she still has her beautiful heart despite everything and i think that's a huge testament to her strength.highly recommend my bestie's memoir. 5 stars!",31-10-2023,1668009048,4,2,20.93,4.5,britney spears,2023,memoir,britney,spears,1,31,10,2023,Autumn,4,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0

"fourth wing (the empyrean, 1)",4.5 stars,sandy farmer,4,"one sunday, i was visiting blogs, which i don't get to do very often, and stumbled upon one that caught my eye. i can't remember the exact wording, but the blogger stated they didn't enjoy a book that was getting a ton of buzz and love. however she worded her comments piqued my interest, so i looked up the book on goodreads and decided almost instantly that it sounded like something i would like. i added it to my wish list, and husband bought it for me for my birthday. i still put off reading it for a while because i needed to focus on review books first. i finally found time to pick it up, and i have to say that i didn't want to put fourth wing down. we never have lazy days where we just let the kids watch tv all day, but husband wasn't feeling well, it was 101 degrees outside, and i was enthralled. so i read every chance i got that first day and read about 80% by midnight. i needed to sleep because i knew that was too much to finish at a reasonable time for me. and i finished the other 20% the next day.fourth wing has everything you could want from the first release in a new fantasy series. you have a flawed leading character--violet is fragile. her bones break easily, her joints and ligaments are weak as well. she is short. and generally not physically strong. she is, however, brilliantly intelligent. she spent her entire life training to go to the scribe quadrant. but her mother, one of the nation's top military leaders, decrees that violet will enter the dragon rider's quadrant instead.the rider's quadrant is a vicious school of tests and challenges that will end with more cadets dead than alive. often times the tests kill the cadets. just as often, the other cadets will do the killing. and what deaths remain are likely from the dragons themselves! unique schools like this are why series like harry potter, vampire academy, divergent, red rising, and even throne of glass have been wildly popular and universally loved.and i mean dragons! the appeal of these mythological creatures is fascinating. perhaps because they're imaginary, we love the different iterations of dragons throughout various literature and media. fourth wing's dragons are some of the best i've come across, from the varieties and their discerning qualities to their ability and willingness to bond to humans. plus, the bond enables a psychic connection with their riders. these dragons are so well done. i applaud rebecca yarros for her imagination and vivid depictions in bringing them all to life.the friends are an interesting variety as well. there are friendships that form almost instantly, those that have spanned entire lifetimes, those that form unexpectedly, and even ones that form begrudgingly. the personalities differ as much as the dragons and the abilities they bestow upon their riders. violet's older sister, mira, warns her against forming friendships in the rider's quadrant. allies are important, but friendship can often be a liability. plus, when cadets are dying more frequently than surviving, forming friendships means saying goodbye to people who have shared pieces of their hearts with you and vice versa. but violet doesn't survive the rider's quadrant by following the path others have established. she must survive by her own instincts and her own journey through the tests and trials.speaking of abilities, rebecca yarros also did an excellent job creating a wide range of abilities since there are so many different characters. none of the signets were too similar to each other. and i loved the intrigue of wondering what new talent would be gifted to the next cadet. she even forms opposite sides of a coin without it appearing to be mirror talents.the enemies were fierce. we start off with violet being warned by her sister mira to steer clear of xaden riorson because he will kill her as soon as he gets the chance as revenge for what her mother did to his father in executing the king's justice for his father's rebellion. violet meets him almost immediately. nearly the same time, a brutal new cadet sets his sights on her as an easy target to weed out the weak links. only violet embarrasses the new cadet, and he swears revenge that he will kill her. and he's not the only person she ticks off during her first year. xaden is hard to read. he forces violet into his wing since he's a wingleader. he bounces back and forth between giving her advice that will help her survive, ignoring her completely, and sending others to her in ways that could be construed either for or against her.of course, the driving questions are about whether violet will survive each challenge she's faced with. if she does, will a dragon want to bond with her? at least until you get to a point where you have answers to these questions, and then you want to know what will happen next. i can't reveal those questions to you as they'd be spoilers.favorite quotes:-""they choose for reasons they don't see fit to share with us."" he pushes off his desk. ""and not all strength is physical, violet.""-you are not attracted to toxic men, i remind myself...i had to laugh at that one.-""one does not live a century without being well aware of the space one takes up.""-""justice is not always merciful.""-""i know you just want to keep me safe,...,""i whisper. ""but keeping me safe is also keeping me from growing, too.""-""i will hate you for this."" ""yeah."" he nods, a flash of pure regret crossing his face as he draws away. ""i can live with that.""-""andarna is my favorite.""-""you can ride me when the flesh rots off my bones, wingleader.""-""whatever you feel is natural. allow yourself to feel it, but then let it go.""-""...if we let fear kill whatever this is between us, then we don't deserve it.""-""one generation to change the text. one generation to choose to teach that text. the next grows, and the lie becomes history.""i was so disheartened when i finished fourth wing and went to go purchase iron flame only to find that it wasn't released yet. the unique school setting where the cadets die more often than survive. the friends. the enemies. the romance. the dragons. all of it was exactly what i look for in a series. now, i will say that once the characters leave the setting of the school and undoubtedly have to face the corrupt government, things have the potential to go south like series such as divergent and the hunger games. we shall see if the empyrean series can survive the traps that other series before it fell into or will it thrive similar to series like red rising and throne of glass. that being said, fourth wing gets 4.5 stars. have you read fourth wing? what did you think? let me know!",23-10-2023,1649374046,2,6,16.99,4.8,rebecca yarros,2023,fantasy,rebecca,yarros,1,23,10,2023,Autumn,4,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0
"fourth wing (the empyrean, 1)",amazing,ryan harris,5,"** spoilers **oh, my goodness this book is captivating! it had me hooked from the beginning!let's get into it!violet - love her! she is super smart and figures things out quickly. she is witty and spunky. she loves and protects so many people. she makes so many friends along her journey and protects them ever chance she needs to. she finds friends from her past, dain. (which i'm sorry if you do like him, i didn't like him from the very beginning.) then she finds, rhiannon, ridoc, liam, sawyer and more. even with jack, he was a total ass to her, crazy trying to kill her and she still felt bad that she killed him to protect her friend. she stays in her own lane and works hard to prove that she can be a rider. to prove to her mother and everyone else that she can and will. so, she conquers all of these challenges. she becomes a rider! not only does she pair with one dragon but two! tarin and andarna! to add tarin is mated to a dragon sgaely which is xaden's dragon! connect violet and xaden even more than the automatic connection they already have. let's talk about that! the one person she is told to stay away from is the one guy she falls for!! of course, kind of an enemies to lovers going on. yay! i instantly love xaden and violet together. even when she kept thinking he was going to kill her. i thought no way they're going to end up together or connected one way or another.xaden - total bad-boy vibes, of course. but hides his true feelings for violet. also, the fact that he took over the full responsibility of all the rebel children and had them in scripted into basgiath to either prove loyalty becoming riders and fight for navarre or die trying. better than all of them being killer because their parent were rebels. he is a complete protector, he protected violet every chance he was given but also hid it very well. i am annoyed that he had to be hiding some kind of secret! why couldn't he just tell her everything?? i mean truly i get why he didn't but why? lol. then this whole time he was hiding his true feelings from her. but then it comes out at the very end when he thinks she is going to die.other side notes:back to dain for a bit. i don't like him. he is annoying and is always try to ""protect"" violet but in a way that is whiny and trying to bring her down. his power is to see someone's memory. he secretly uses it on her to see what she knows about xaden. then he tattletales on them to his dad. ugh. i. don't. like. him.so, violet gets two dragons. andarna and tarin is mated to xaden's dragon sgaely. that also makes it so xaden and violet can mind speak to each other. and violet can also communicate with sgaely. then with both their signet powers they are one badass couple. xaden (shadows), violet (lightening). also, how their dragons cannot be away from each other for more than 3 days. i am excited to see where this goes.liam! i am so sad that we lost liam. i cried so much when all of that happened. i was hoping so way that violet could freeze time like she could with adarna but i never did. not only did she lose a great friend, but xaden also lost a brother. it was so sad. i'm definitely going to miss his character.so, xaden and some of the other rebels and dragon were working with gryphons and their fliers. enemies of navarre. they are giving them weapons to help fight the venin and wyvern. violet is completely in the dark about this until the end of the book. these people she thought were a complete fantasy. her father told her stories from a book, he leaves her a hidden letter in the book basically telling her that these people and creatures are real, and their government is hiding the truth from their people. then at the very end of this book someone believed to be dead is actually alive! he is part of the rebellion! i knew something happened at the end due to other people's reactions, but i never thought that, that would be it! definitely a good twist!i cannot wait for november when the 2nd book comes out!",04-09-2023,1649374046,1,6,16.99,4.8,rebecca yarros,2023,fantasy,rebecca,yarros,1,4,9,2023,Autumn,3,Pozitif,Pozitif,0

"fourth wing (the empyrean, 1)",survival of the fittest on a whole other level,scottishwolfdemon,5,"i am a reck after reading this book but in the best of ways. i cannot remember the last time i have been left this way after finishing a book to where i am not sure what to do next whether it is to pick up another book or soak in what i have just finished. i usually go with the former but this time i am probably going to do the later for a day or so. rebecca yarros has successfully put me in a temporary book coma. the world that yarros builds is absolutely stunning and the structure of government and military is solid and makes sense. the characters she has created for this story‚Ä¶. gah i feel like i could wright an essay on quite a few of them easily and that‚Äôs not just counting the main character violet. but i do connect to her the most on a pretty deep level.that connection being having a sever disadvantage in a field that doesn‚Äôt do well with having just one. but she doesn‚Äôt let that stop her if anything it fuels her to prove everyone wrong. i have had to do that myself and really through this book i realized i kind of forgotten to do that here recently and was reminded of that part of my self. so i really admire violet's tenacity, determination, and adaptably in every challenge she faces. but our main character is not the only one i have strong feelings for. yarros has this spectacular ability to get you to almost feel something for most of these characters in this book no matter how long they are in the book, and boy will you feel some feelings while reading this. so for warning feelings will be had!as for the romance and spice i have to say yet again it has been a while since i have been on edge for a relationship development in a story, but again in the best of ways. i would say slow burn is not even an adequate description for them. while yes it takes a minute for our love interests to admit their feelings with each other, the build up to that point wasn‚Äôt a slow burn it was already an inferno really. don‚Äôt know how many times i sat there fanning myself and it wasn‚Äôt even over a spicy scene. but another thing i have to appreciate is that the romance does not over take the main story that is being told. while the romance is to die for, other relationships that are built or building in this story also captivate you as well.another thing about this book that i have to commemorate the author for as a critique is how she is able to get you to feel about movements and the structure of this world as well. you will feel wonder and awe along with sorrow, horror, and anger very easily as this world is developed and certain structures and systems are played out. she has artfully and skillfully found that perfect balance in getting the reader to feel for pretty much the whole entire story and every aspect of it. this is what i believe is what makes this such a great book to read. it is the fact that she does not get you to just feel for the characters in the story but she gets you to feel for everything in this story. i hope she is able to carry this through for the rest of the series because if she can then she has created something special for us and we better prepare to be recked some more for what is to come next.",20-09-2023,1649374046,9,6,16.99,4.8,rebecca yarros,2023,fantasy,rebecca,yarros,1,20,9,2023,Autumn,3,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0
"fourth wing (the empyrean, 1)",a certified page turner,basil argyros,5,"rebecca yarros has 'it' -- the gift of writing certifiable page-turners. i'm an old hand at fantasy literature, and i'm embarrassed to confess how often i robbed myself of sleep by reading 'one more chapter' in fourth wing past my usual bedtime. if she continues in this vein, her new series will be a commercial blockbuster. kudos. it also qualifies as a crossover adult/ya series (more on this, later in the review).to step back and give it a critical evaluation -- for any fantasy novel or series, the first criteria is whether the world the author builds is interesting, and believable. the geography in fourth wing is pedestrian, but serviceable. the society adheres to the usual fantasy requirement of technological stagnation over a period of centuries. the culture in fourth wing, with its high level of literacy and the absence of plate armor, resembles rome more than the usual 'medieval' setting, which is rather refreshing. magic furnishes some quasi-modern amenities (e.g., 'mage lights' that illuminate interior rooms).the society is interesting. if rebecca were toiling in the star trek novel fields, her 'riders quadrant' would make a nice analogue of starfleet academy -- in the mirror universe. martial arts training is all full-contact, edged weapons included. cadets in this elite institution routinely kill each other, with few repercussions.the human-dragon relationship is symbiotic. a human to whom a dragon chooses to bond will acquire special abilities, fueled by the dragon's magical nature. to use another star trek analogy, human and dragon are like trill and symbiont -- while a dragon can survive the loss of its rider, a human, once bonded, cannot survive the death of its dragon.the aspect of the society that i most appreciated is the obvious 'secret' that the established ruling elites are ruthless bastards who carefully control the prevailing narratives to keep the masses in line and patriotic, while themselves are completely amoral. this is where rebecca's fantasy world shines, with this resemblance to our contemporary world.the heroine, violet, is an analogue of rebecca herself. no fault there -- authors re-imagining themselves in their fiction has a long, and often successful, history. what makes violet interesting is that rebecca has replicated her own, very difficult medical challenges in her heroine. (this is surely the first work of fiction in which forms of the word 'subluxation' occur repeatedly.) i give her credit for this, for it makes violet more interesting (i can't help but be reminded of moorcook's elric, whose physical weakness from his albinism is compensated for only by drugs, or the possession of stormbringer).i have a few literary criticisms, none of which will detract from (indeed, they'll probable add to) the series' appeal. for example, applicants to the death factory that is the riders quadrant are almost puppy-dog eager to get in -- seemingly unoppressed by the reality that three-quarters of them (if i remember correctly) will die during training. they also look and talk like contemporary zoomers. this is part of the ya appeal of the books, but it's a bit of a stretch to imagine contemporary zoomers cheerfully signing up for such a place! the sex scenes are painstakingly detailed, with truly anatomic precision. for a ya audience, i suppose this might be useful information, but for an adult reader, they become tedious rather quickly.congratulations, rebecca. i look forward to receiving my pre-order of flame wing . . . :)",31-10-2023,1649374046,4,6,16.99,4.8,rebecca yarros,2023,fantasy,rebecca,yarros,1,31,10,2023,Autumn,4,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0
"fourth wing (the empyrean, 1)",i can‚Äôt believe i waited so long to read this epic book,heidi dischler,5,"guys. i‚Äôm not lying here: 2023 is my year for reading. i cannot tell you how many books i‚Äôve read that have been so astonishingly beautiful and amazing and overall top tier. this novel is no exception.coming into this book, i wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. the only other book i‚Äôve read by rebecca yarros is the things we leave unfinished. also amazing, but if you‚Äôve read it you know it‚Äôs on a completely different playing field than this book. i mean, fourth wing is on a different world and isn‚Äôt a historical romance novel. it is epic, though, and i‚Äôm not using that word lightly.fourth wing is a fantasy novel set in the world of navarre where dragons, griffins, and magic are real. if you‚Äôve followed a majority of my reviews on my blog, you know that i hardly ever review fantasy novels. i honestly think the only other fantasy novel i‚Äôve reviewed was the invisible life of addie larue, which honestly was a real world fantasy, so wasn‚Äôt that far outside of my realm. with that being said, this book is outside of my typical comfort zone but holy hell did i love it. now i‚Äôm thinking i‚Äôve been missing out on all of these amazing fantasy novels and i might just go on a binge.so, what exactly did i like about this novel? everything. but to break it down: the world building that went into writing this is absolutely insane and makes it an amazing read in itself; the characters that don‚Äôt necessarily make you think ‚Äúoh this again‚Äù with the main heroine; the unbeatable plot; and the beautiful, comical writing style that rebecca yarros demonstrates.the world building speaks for itself, but the characters that don‚Äôt follow typical patterns particularly made me like this novel. for instance, our main heroine, violet, is way weaker than other riders. she doesn‚Äôt fit the mould. while this is typical for our main character, what follows isn‚Äôt. instead of her beating all odds and becoming the strongest rider of all, she basically just‚Ä¶ adjusts. she has to do things differently and doesn‚Äôt just become a natural born rider. it‚Äôs amazing and you‚Äôll know what i‚Äôm talking about if you‚Äôve read the book.the plot is just like what i said: unbeatable. you have foreshadowing, a romantic subplot, tension and high stakes throughout the entire novel, and man is it satisfying. i‚Äôm not sure how long this series is going to be, but i am here for it.lastly, rebecca yarros‚Äô writing style in this novel is nothing short of spectacular. you get epic battle scenes, romantic moments that play with your heart, and comical snips that make you laugh out loud. it really does have everything and i was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire novel.overall, this review is huge but i had a lot to say. i honestly can‚Äôt even point to something that i disliked about this novel, which just goes to show you how much i loved it and how great i think it is. if you enjoy fantasy novels, you‚Äôll fall in love with this book. if you don‚Äôt enjoy fantasy novels? you‚Äôll still fall in love with this book. i‚Äôve already recommended it to my book club, my mom, and my brother. y‚Äôall are welcome.favorite quote: ‚Äúand when others are quick to stand in front of me, xaden always stands at my side, trusting me to hold my own.‚Äù",06-10-2023,1649374046,12,6,16.99,4.8,rebecca yarros,2023,fantasy,rebecca,yarros,1,6,10,2023,Autumn,4,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0

(speaking of the end of the book - i'll definitely be coming back to that one later!) and there is spice... i don't know why but i wasn't expecting the spice that i got from it. then i got to it and hellooooooo shadow daddy!!! ü§§ i assumed there would be some flirting and some fade to black stuff but nope - rebecca gave us a full-on adult fantasy complete with tension, steam, and chemistry. plus, it was the perfect amount. not too much and not too little. ü§åüèªmy favorite thing though, besides the killer storyline going on here, is the little moments of humor and found family sprinkled throughout. i love it when i can laugh with the characters in a book even if chaos and/or danger is surrounding them. humor and sarcasm are coping mechanisms for me so this not only had me engrossed in the story but it left me feeling like these characters were more alive than just words on a page.as for the ending... let me just say that i never saw it coming. i usually can spot the twists a mile away and i did in fact spot one of them but that wasn't the biggest one. it wasn't the bombshell dropped at the last possible minute that made waiting for the next book torture even though it will be here in like a week or so lol. i don't know how all of these people who read this when it came out haven't gone mad with the wait because it's only been days for me and i'm still trying not to scream over it anymore!so if you're about to jump into this one just buckle up. it's full of action, laughs, drama, secrets, suspense, passion, and so much more. once you get to the last 20ish percent or so don't make any plans that will cause you to put this book down because you will wish you hadn't. i'm telling you i could not function like a normal adult until i finished it. i was angry, i was shocked, i bawled my eyes out (i mean why rebecca? just why?!), i swooned all over the place, and then my head exploded with six little words... ü§Øenjoy!!!",01-11-2023,1649374046,9,6,16.99,4.8,rebecca yarros,2023,fantasy,rebecca,yarros,1,1,11,2023,Autumn,4,Negatif,Pozitif,0

"fourth wing (the empyrean, 1)",lords of discipline + dragonriders of pern + ...steamy romance? but it works!,greg barlin,5,"i first came across fourth wing when i noticed it in the #1 position on amazon's best science fiction and fantasy of 2023 so far. but beyond that selection, i looked at how the reviews were trending. at the time, there were more than 21,000 reviews (it's now about to crest 40,000), and the average was a whopping 4.8 stars. it has to be good for that many people to love it, right? in need of a palate cleanser after the difficult read that was the whispers, i decided i'd limit the likelihood of another clunker and see what all the hype is about. and i'm happy to say that i get why so many people love this book: it's pretty great.fourth wing is set at basgiath war college in the mythical land of navarre. it opens on conscription day, where thousands of twenty-year-olds assemble to take their place among the healers, scribes, or infantry. the most elite of them try to join the most selective branch and become dragon riders.our heroine is violet sorrengail. bookish and smart, yet frail, she always imagined a future as a scribe, just as her father had been. but her mother is a rider and a general in the army, and she has other ideas. against violet's wishes, her mother insists she attempt to be a rider as well. but this isn't an idle push in a different direction. the stakes are the highest possible for those trying to become riders: from the opening conscription challenge through bonding with a dragon, there are dozens of opportunities to fail, and any failure when attempting to become a rider equals death.in addition to the general peril of the tasks at hand, there is also a ruthlessness among the members of the war college. fewer classmates means better opportunities to bond a dragon, and so the murder of fellow classmates, while perhaps not encouraged, is certainly allowed, making every waking moment one filled with potential death. yarros creates an interesting caste within the college of students who carry ""rebellion relics"". they are the children of adults involved in a rebellious uprising six years prior. all of the adults were executed, and the children were only spared execution as well by being forced into conscription as riders. as a result, they all tend to possess a brooding darkness -- you could think of them as the ""slytherin"" of basgiath. to further complicate things for violet, those children of the rebels all intensely hate her because violet's mother was responsible for ordering their parents' execution.the novel is packed with a ton of genre-bending elements. there is the basic plot -- violet's unlikely journey through her first year at basgiath war college -- which stirred up memories of one of my all-time favorite books, pat conroy's the lords of discipline, based on conroy's first year at the citadel military college. there are dragons and dragon riders, which of course evokes memories of plenty of fantasy novels, with anne mccaffrey's dragonriders of pern series top of mind. and then there's some romance, and a potential love triangle, which starts out feeling like something from a ya novel, but ends up a lot more r-rated and steamy, and more akin to what you might find in a novel with fabio on the cover. add to this a nuanced backstory and some misdirection on who the reader should trust and believe, and fourth wing truly has something for everyone.there is depth to the story and characters, which elevates the story and i'm sure plays a big role in the stellar reviews. yarros handles relationships well, whether it's the strained relationship between violet and her mother, the love between violet and her sister, or the friendships violet forges with her classmates. the romance is the romance; honestly i could have done without it, and while it was almost humorous at times, it works for what it is meant to be. yarros also does a standout job of presenting how her characters handle loss. whether it's grieving the loss of family members or their classmates, there is an undercurrent of sadness and longing that affects many of the characters and hardens them to the task at hand. despite the intensity of their training, yarros does a pretty good job reminding us that they're only in their early twenties and still figuring out a lot of life.i suspect a lot of the hype and enjoyment of the book is related to how yarros turns a straightforward ""year 1 as a student story"" into something more. i can't help but compare that to the harry potter books (except, of course, harry never had hot magical sex with ginny weasley -- at least not within the pages of any of the books!). those novels changed significantly for me with the third book in the series, the prisoner of azkaban. where books 1 and 2 were decent and straightforward ya novels, the prisoner of azkaban took the story to a more nuanced and mature level. yarros does the same thing here, but all within the pages of a single book. i get why people are so drawn to the story.overall, it's a winner. it's fun, and while it feels derivative of several other novels, it also combines those stories and plots in its own unique way. book 2, iron flame, is already set for release this november (i've already ordered my copy!), and so if you fall in love with the characters, you'll have the opportunity to spend more time with them before long (well, at least with those who survive fourth wing). it's a compelling read and like the other 40,000+ readers who have this trending at almost 5 stars, i don't think you'll be disappointed.",17-07-2023,1649374046,13,6,16.99,4.8,rebecca yarros,2023,fantasy,rebecca,yarros,1,17,7,2023,Summer,3,Pozitif,Pozitif,0
no brainer (diary of a wimpy kid book 18),best book ever - from a 10 year old,kmg,5,"i was very excited for this new book to come out. i am a huge fan of this series and have been reading it for years. i just finished reading it a few minutes ago (it came in mail yesterday afternoon) and i already am waiting to see what happens to greg next. i have every single book in the whole series and i care about these characters a lot. i have read most of the books at least five times each.i like the series because greg is funny and it's sort of funny how no matter what happens, he just rolls with his life. i don't really like that poor greg never really has a ""happy"" ending. my mom says it's because the story is told from his perspective.in this book, the school is losing money because the kids are not getting good grades. this sounds crazy, but it can really happen! so, the school decided to give rewards to kids who got higher grades. the robot cleaner in the book reminded me of the grocery store robot in my town. it's cute with its big, googly eyes.mom says:reading has always been a focus in our home. we believe in reading and education and being able to research things on our own. we are teaching this foundation to our children. i spent a couple hours each day reading to my kids when they were little. we read the entire harry potter series aloud to them in 2021, before bedtime for an hour each night.reading has always been important.¬†my daughter was not a confident reader six years ago, when she was four and five years old. i got the wimpy kid books for her, hoping it would be entertaining enough, and easy enough, to keep her motivated to finish books.since she read the first few books at age 5 or 6 years old, she has become a voracious reader. she reads one or two books a day now. she reads chapter books, 200-page books with no pictures in them. she is an excellent reader and i find books all over the house now, in places where she was sequestered away, enjoying a story- and it started with the wimpy kid series.i've even sat down to read several of the wimpy books myself. i can finish the books in 30 minutes with my morning coffee and i find myself oftentimes laughing out loud to them. i hope he keeps them light and silly- and we will keep reading them.",25-10-2023,1419766945,9,8,8.55,4.8,jeff kinney,2023,"humor, middle grade",jeff,kinney,3,25,10,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,0

all the light we cannot see: a novel,a beautiful and enlightening world war ii novel,tigerlily64,5,"if i could give ‚Äúall the light we cannot see‚Äù more than five stars, i would. i read this amazing book on kindle and listened to it on audible, as well. btw the narrator on audible, zach appelman, is really excellent. his ability to pronounce the french and german names, his articulation and his pregnant pauses really added to the reading of this book.anthony doerr‚Äôs book is simply stunning. dazzling is a good word for it. i have reviewed many other books and have sometimes said this or that writer writes fluidly and well. i have given five stars to quite a few writers. ‚Äúall the light we cannot see‚Äù is a higher level of excellence that not many authors achieve. no wonder anthony doerr won the 2015 pulitzer prize for fiction with this book!the chapters are short and beautifully written. i could say ‚Äúbeautifully and elegantly painted‚Äù; they remind me of a painting. this book is poetic, creative, imaginative and historically enlightening as well. science and technology, it‚Äôs fascination and the power to help or harm, is explored along with the characters‚Äô thoughts and feelings; we learn about their courage or lack of and why they make their individual decisions during the rise of hitler and on into world war ii. the descriptions are incredibly sensitive and vivid. objects are palpable; i could see and feel them. the book pulled me in so much that i was part of each scene. the poignant images remained with me and made the characters come alive.the author skillfully writes using a juxtaposition of events in the life of a blind french girl, marie-laure leblanc, and that of a german boy, werner pfennig. towards the end of the book their lives meet.marie-laure, the blind french girl, lives with her father in paris. she became blind at 6 years old due to congenital cataracts. she has developed her other senses, namely, hearing, touch and smell to compensate for her loss of sight. in her imagination, she can see colors when she uses her other senses to explore her world. her father carves wooden replicas of all the buildings in paris for her to learn to find her way home by herself. he is a very devoted and loving father and teaches her independence but promises her he will always be there for her and will never leave her. he is the master locksmith at the museum of natural history. marie-laure, who is a curious and bright child, goes with him to work and studies paleontology, archeology, geology and other branches of science with dr. gefford, while her father works.the boy, werner, lives in an orphanage, ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs house‚Äù in zollverein, germany. the children in the orphanage are very close to starving. a good deal of the population is very poor and not getting enough to eat. when hitler comes to power, the economy improves dramatically. people are getting more food (meat even) and new appliances. the german population is inundated with radio propaganda. only state supported german radio channels are allowed. the german population is brainwashed. the people think hitler is helping them climb out of poverty, build a better society and take pride in their country again.yet the future looks bleak to werner. nazi officials tell the boys in the orphanage that they will all have to work in the coalmines when they turn 15 years of age. werner‚Äôs father had died in the coal mines, and werner is not happy with the prospect of being underground in the dark pit of the mines. after finding a broken radio in the city trash, werner gets it working. his fascination with radios and his skill in fixing them gives him a chance to escape the coal mines and go to paramilitary school. he has a chance to pursue his interest in radio technology and contribute to the new germany. he visualizes a glorious future. in the attic at the orphanage, werner and his sister jutta had listened to foreign radio stations that were illegal under nazi rule. a french radio station with science lectures fascinated them. how magical it was to hear a voice from afar, transmitted through the air! jutta liked a program on magnets. werner liked the program on light. ‚Äúwhat do we call visible light? we call it color. but the electromagnetic spectrum runs to zero in one direction and infinity in the other, so really children, mathematically, all of light is invisible.‚Äù the radio was a symbol of freedom for them both, the freedom to learn and dream.before he leaves for school, however, werner smashes the radio. he does not want anything to interfere with his chance for what he thinks will be a better life. listening to foreign radio stations is illegal and dangerous. jutta, a free spirit with a strong moral compass, feels betrayed. she thinks her brother is turning into a cold, brutal nazi like hans and herribert, two older boys in the orphanage who have joined the brown-shirted hitler youth. she insists that the broadcasts from the foreign radio stations say the germans are committing atrocities, just the opposite of what they hear on the state-owned german stations.werner gets caught up with his study of radios and blocks out the brutality around him at school. despite his lack of courage to go against the dictates of his german superiors, the reader can see his conflict and the goodness in him that he wants to embrace. his friend, frederick, a bird-lover and dreamer, is called the ‚Äúweakest‚Äù by the field commander but shows his courage by refusing to participate in the brutal death of a prisoner. frederick pays for it by being beaten so badly that he becomes no more than a living vegetable.with the invasion of paris in 1940, marie-laure and her father escape to saint-malo on the brittany coast and find refuge with marie-laure‚Äôs great uncle, etienne. again her father observes and measures the buildings of this new city and carves a wooden replica of all 865 buildings. unfortunately, his efforts cause suspicion, and he is arrested on his way back to paris on an errand for the museum of natural history. he is convicted of ‚Äútheft and conspiracy‚Äù and sent to a prison in germany. feeling abandoned but gathering her inner strength, marie-laure continues to live with her great uncle, etienne, and his housekeeper madame manec. madame manec starts working for the french resistance and marie-laure takes over some of her activities when the housekeeper becomes ill. upon madame manec‚Äôs death from pneumonia, etienne gets his courage up and joins the french resistance.werner finds himself caught up in the brutality with no way to escape. his skill in detecting enemy radio transmissions results in many deaths, some of them innocent civilians. he is haunted by the deaths, especially that of one little girl in vienna who reminded him of his sister, jutta. werner is sent to saint-malo to find the source of the radio transmissions of the french resistance. he finds marie-laure‚Äôs broadcasts, but does not expose her. he recognizes the radio programs that had inspired him so much as a child. when he hears her voice saying that someone is in her house and is going to kill her, he vows to save her if he can reach her in time. werner finds her and saves her life. the americans are bombing the town, but during a lull, he helps her escape saint-malo.intertwined with the lives of our two main characters, marie-laure and werner, fairytale and reality collide. the legend of the ‚Äúsea of flames‚Äù, a 133 carat diamond said to be the intended gift of the goddess of the earth to the god of the sea, parallels the calamities the characters experience in their lives. it was said that the person who had the diamond would live forever, but those he loved around him would die. if the stone were returned to the sea, the curse would be lifted. especially during the bombing of saint-malo, marie-laure and werner both draw parallels to their own predicaments and jules verne‚Äôs ‚Äútwenty thousand leagues under the sea‚Äù. trapped in the basement of the hotel of bees in saint-malo, werner listens to marie-laure‚Äôs broadcasts of the science programs and music that had been recorded by her deceased grandfather. he thinks of captain nemo being trapped under the sea in the nautilus. werner and his fellow german soldier, volkheimer, have run out of food and water and have very little air. ‚Äúwho could possibly calculate the minimum time required for us to get out? might we not be asphyxiated before the nautilus could surface?‚Äù are more monsters awaiting them when they do surface?marie-laure is trapped in her uncle etienne‚Äôs secret attic room where he had broadcast codes for the french resistance. down below is an intruder, the nazi sergeant major von rumpel. he is there to find the ‚Äúsea of flames‚Äù diamond, which her father hid in the wooden house replica of her great uncle‚Äôs house. instead of giving it to the reich for hitler‚Äôs dream museum in linz, austria, he wants to have the enchanted diamond to cure his cancerous tumor. he is dying, and he believes the diamond will save his life. marie-laure has not had food for two days and has had no water for one and a half days. she starts to think maybe this nazi will spare her life if she gives him the diamond. maybe the curse would end and her father would come back. not trusting her safety, however, she has a knife handy. she thinks of captain nemo when he said to ned land, the canadian harpooner, ‚Äúbut let me tell you that if we‚Äôre caught, i‚Äôm going to defend myself, even if i die doing it‚Äù.there are many levels to this book and much to think about. the reader can get many insights into the human condition and why someone like hitler could take over germany and spread his sickness into so many other countries. the book is well researched and taught me a good deal about how it was to grow up in germany when hitler came to power. additionally, i could understand more concretely how it was for the french when france was invaded by hitler's armies. good historical fiction brings all these events to life. anthony doerr brings a powerful humanism to the events in world war ii. he made the characters come alive for me. this is a book to ponder, reread and treasure. the author brings an incredible immediacy to his writing that will draw you in and stay with you, perhaps, forever.",14-10-2015,1501173219,8,10,11.98,4.5,anthony doerr,2014,historical fiction,anthony,doerr,2,14,10,2015,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,1
all the light we cannot see: a novel,it‚Äôs as if he sacrificed characters for beautiful prose.,denise baer,2,"anthony doerr‚Äôs descriptions are like no others. he molds landscapes, wars with words until my heart thumped from the vision he created for me. they‚Äôre unique. i‚Äôd like to share a few of the descriptions that i enjoyed.‚Äúto the bombardiers, the walled city on its granite headland, drawing ever closer, looks like an unholy tooth, something black and dangerous, a final abscess to be lanced away.‚Äù‚Äúthe appetite for oxygen is such that objects heavier than housecats are dragged into the flames.‚Äù‚Äúhis breath smells like crushed insects.‚Äù‚Äúas though a weary tide stirs stones in the old woman‚Äôs lungs.‚Äùthe way he guides the reader‚Äôs vision of a place, destruction, appearance, made me wish i had a pinky size of his talent. i‚Äôm a reader who loves and underlines phrases and sentences that stand out. that i haven‚Äôt read before. strands of words, like a string of pearls, fitted together to catapult me into another world. who let me become friends or enemies with the characters. some writers know how to bring me into their worlds where i get to exercise all senses and emotions.there will be spoilers in this review, so if you plan on reading the book, don‚Äôt read this review. i do want to mention that i‚Äôm not a fan of some of the classics. a reader needs patience to trudge through pages of description. i‚Äôve tried the count of monte cristo by alexandre dumas and anna karenina by leo tolstoy. maybe i‚Äôm just not that intelligent to appreciate and distinguish fine prose. whatever the reason, this may give you an idea as to whether or not you want to continue reading.that said i feel like doerr‚Äôs novel falls into a classics category‚Äîfull of description. i really wanted to love this book. it‚Äôs safe to say i wasn‚Äôt the audience he had in mind when writing it, and i'm in the minority of disliking it. as much as i adore his descriptions, i equally dislike his writing style. it‚Äôs as if he sacrificed characters for beautiful prose. the amount of descriptions, tangents, lists, and short chapters swallow up the characters. if i can‚Äôt connect with them, there‚Äôs no way i‚Äôm going to like the book. this book is roughly 530 pages long. it really should have been half its length.point of viewfirst, the book is told in third person omniscient, meaning the narrator knows all the thoughts and feelings of the characters. the narrator isn‚Äôt a character nor does the narration come from a character‚Äôs perspective. it‚Äôs some unknown person telling me all about the thoughts and feelings of the personas. i can‚Äôt recall reading a book with this pov, but i don‚Äôt like it. eleven percent into the book, my frustration got the best of me. the pov and descriptions muddled my experience. there were passages where i couldn‚Äôt figure out if it was the character‚Äôs thoughts or feelings or the narrator‚Äôs.‚Äúblock out giant frank volkheimer with his mammoth boots and cinder-block jaw. block out the little aristocratic professor pacing in front of the hearth and the late hour and the dogs and the shelves brimming with interesting things. there is only this.‚Äù when reading this passage, it sounded as if werner was talking to himself. but he couldn‚Äôt be since it‚Äôs in third person.‚Äúthe first policeman snaps flesh off his apple with his teeth. are they looking at her?‚Äù uh, she‚Äôs blind. the narrator is telling me what the police are doing, and then jumps into marie-laure‚Äôs head. at first, i thought marie-laure was describing the policeman and then wondering if they were looking at her. this wouldn‚Äôt work either, because if she doesn‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre looking at her, she wouldn‚Äôt know what the policeman is doing.prosethere were images in the book where i couldn‚Äôt picture it. maybe i‚Äôm dense, but it just didn‚Äôt sound right. this might seem nitpicky, however doerr is praised for his prose‚Äîprose that took ten-years to write. i‚Äôll share a few examples with you.‚Äú‚Ä¶and she thinks she can smell threads of dust cascading from the ceiling.‚Äù two issues with this description, 1) how does one smell threads of dust? and 2) how does a girl who goes blind at the age of six ‚Äòthink‚Äô she smells threads of dust?‚Äúin the gloaming to the east, he can make out a gray line of traffic herded between the edges of the road.‚Äù gloaming? i had to look that up, which means twilight, dusk. okay, it‚Äôs not his fault my vocabulary is limited, but it made me think if gloam has more power than twilight. gloam is something i can see in a poem. why not just say, ‚Äúthe twilight in the east revealed a gray line of traffic herded between the edges of the road.‚Äù?‚Äúthe eggs taste like clouds. like spun gold.‚Äù huh? this is such a weird comparison. how do clouds taste, and if i‚Äôve ever tasted them, they sure as heck wouldn‚Äôt taste like eggs. or spun gold, which i would never eat unless someone wanted to steal it from me.listsdoerr‚Äôs writing also consists of lists throughout the book. i call the separate words or phrases placed one after the other as lists. he‚Äôs a natural born list maker, which drove me nuts and came off as page fillers.‚Äúlight, electricity, ether. space, time, mass. heinrich hertz‚Äôs principles of mechanics. heissmeyers famous schools. code breaking, rocket propulsion, all the latest.‚Äù‚Äúmarie-laure wakes to church bells: two three four five.‚Äù he does this too much in the book that it lost its flair. ‚Äúwind: immediate, bright, sweet, briny, luminous.‚Äùalong with the lists, doerr also counts. ‚Äúshe wakes to madame manec‚Äôs blocky pumps climbing to the third floor the fourth the fifth.‚Äù no punctuation, and continues the counting. ‚Äúher heart beats two four six eight.‚Äù counting doesn‚Äôt build intrigue, so why have it?‚Äústatic static static static static. in his functioning ear, in the radio, in the air.‚Äù gah!!!tangentsthen there are tangents. many times the narrator tells us the characters are recalling memories when doerr should have put more time into the moment. he‚Äôll start a chapter about a character, the character starts thinking about the past, and then the chapter ends.charactersdoerr spent plenty of time giving me a visualization of the places, yet he fell short of showing me the characters. also, the abundance of small chapters create long gaps between characters. for instance, chapter 79 talks about von rumple‚Äôs diagnosis, and if i'm not mistaken, the next mention of him is chapter 92.to top it off, in regards to marie-laure, the narrator tells me ‚Äúshe thinks‚Äù or ‚Äúshe feels‚Äù instead of showing me what she thought, or what she felt, and sometimes it being impossible. when talking about marie-laure, the author should have applied the senses using his beautiful prose. she‚Äôs blind, so use her touch, smell, taste to understand where she is or how she came to an assumption. instead, doerr uses the narrator. below are a few i‚Äôve chosen:‚Äúat the top, she stands; she has the sense of a long slope-walled space pressed beneath the gable of the roof.‚Äù how does she ‚Äúsense‚Äù this without touch? the author describes so many things indepth and then just states how she senses it. she has needed her father to make a replica of the town, which she memorized over the years, yet she can ‚Äúsense‚Äù this area.‚Äú‚Ä¶but marie-laure is certain that when they stopped to greet a woman on the way here, madame dropped off one envelope and picked up another.‚Äù the girl is blind. did she hear the rustling of paper? a handshake? ‚Äú‚Ä¶marie-laure heard the rustling of paper when they stopped to greet a woman on the way here, a slight snigger escaped their lips before they moved on.‚Äù‚Äúinsects drone: wasps, hoverlies, a passing dragonfly‚Äîetienne has taught marie-laure to distinguish each by its sound.‚Äù etienne hasn‚Äôt been out of the house in about twenty-years and marie only goes to certain places. how is it that he taught her how to distinguish between these sounds.these additional descriptions are some issues i had with other characters.‚Äúyour problem, werner,‚Äù says frederick, ‚Äúis that you still believe you own your life.‚Äù this couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth. werner never acted as if he owned his life. frederick did. frederick continued to be himself. he stood up and refused to pour cold water on a prisoner. the women in town who transferred information to one another had more guts than werner.in the chapter, diagnosis, the author throws in a little bit about the medical exam while the rest of the chapter is about finding jewels. doerr has the characters reflect on other things instead of describing the moment.there‚Äôs a passage where werner sneaks away to see frederick in the infirmary. he‚Äôs talking to a nurse, and then out of the blue comes, ‚Äúeach time he blinks, he sees the men of his childhood, laid-off miners drifting through back alleys, men with hooks for fingers and vacuums for eyes; he sees bastian standing over a smoking river, snow falling all around him.‚Äù again, the author takes us into a reflection without really describing the moment. i also couldn‚Äôt make the connection between the conversation and his thoughts of the past.the past thoughts with the short chapters and flip-flopping from one character to another, prevented me from having an emotional connection. i didn‚Äôt care about them except for frederick. when werner died, i didn‚Äôt feel sorry for him or cry, which shocked me since i cry just watching a hallmark movie.due to all of these issues, i gave this book a 2 star rating.",20-01-2016,1501173219,9,10,11.98,4.5,anthony doerr,2014,historical fiction,anthony,doerr,2,20,1,2016,Winter,1,Pozitif,Pozitif,2
all the light we cannot see: a novel,stunning,james parnassus,5,"""daddy, are you crying? why are you crying?"" that was my daughter when she came downstairs the morning i finished this book to find me sitting on the couch clutching it on my lap. i can't remember the last time i read something that affected me in this powerful a way.the spiral construction of the plot reminded me of a symphony, with stories that initially seem disparate but then you start to recognize patterns and see how the parts fit together and long before the end you are marveling at the brilliance of how the author can have conceived of it all. and just as impactful was the exquisite, poetic language and how doerr describes the most ordinary details of life in a way that makes you realize how beautiful those things you normally don't even notice are.i think what made me cry when i finished it was something that happened near the end which i won't go into so as not to spoil it for anyone, the way characters in the story retain their decency and humanity in the midst of the horrors of war, and most of all the fact that it was over and i wouldn't be able to keep reading it any more.",03-11-2023,1501173219,1,10,11.98,4.5,anthony doerr,2014,historical fiction,anthony,doerr,2,3,11,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Negatif,9
all the light we cannot see: a novel,see the light through superb writing with profound lessons,booksalottle,5,"being the recipient of the 2015 pulitzer prize for fiction, my expectations for 'all the light we cannot see' were extremely high. with all things considered, i feel confident in saying that the critical acclaim was warranted and deserved in this case. despite two minor annoyances, which i cover at the end, 'all the light we cannot see' is a phenomenally written, percipient, and remarkable example of sound literature.author anthony doerr tells the story of how 18 years old werner, a geeky, crafty, and thoughtful engineering prodigy in germany, meets 16 years old marie-laure, a sweet, astute, and affable blind french girl during the siege of saint-malo in 1944. wwii, with all its stentorian and fervid trappings of war is the backdrop to werner and marie-laure's fateful encounter. written in short but vividly described, intricately woven chapters, the backstory of how they are brought together is told over the course of ten years starting in 1944 and flashing back as far as 1934. through alternating timelines from both their perspectives, they meet and thereafter, the aftermath and implications of the encounter is written about up until the year 2014.several pages into the novel, i knew i had a special literary piece in my hands. werner and marie-laure are easy to fall in love with as doerr writes them in a way that is honest and open. they are both multi-faceted in their strengths and their vulnerabilities, without either one playing a victim. or at least, i never saw either one as a victim. i also appreciated that foibles, frailty, and other unsavory personality traits are depicted for both, allowing them to be alive with authenticity. i never want to read about characters who are too perfect and give the sun, the moon, and the stars all of the time. in the case of this novel, the two main protagonists are realistic for their time and for the circumstances they find themselves in. joining werner and marie-laure is a dynamic, and at times unfortunate mix of supporting characters who collectively illuminate the radiance and light of when humanity is good and kind. juxtaposed, others in the mix depict the ugly darkness of when humanity resorts to selfishness and evil. though they are fictional, we should all be so lucky as to encounter characters like frederick, madame manec, frau elena, and dr. geffard, and hope the world breeds less of dr. hauptmann, bastian, and reinhold von rumpel.'all the light we cannot see' has many lessons to impart on the reader, with one of the most profound being the titular light that we must all see. the novel soundly shows us how those who are blind in the literal sense, can see more than those who have the ability to gaze as far as their eyes will carry. additionally, the novel allows the reader to see for themselves how people whose visions are symbolically foggy, can still find goodness of heart and lightness of mind in unlikely places, and in the unlikeliest of people. thought-provokingly, doerr weaves for the reader how darkness creeps and consumes those who choose to be figuratively blind and who later become disillusioned by their own rancor, malevolence, and enmity. in the heart of strong-willed characters, we see how love, patience, understanding and empathy become the key that open and illuminate the path into light.i very much enjoyed this read, and surprisingly, the short chapters were not an annoyance as can sometimes be when the author is not skilled enough to execute them. doerr is skilled and in the case of 'all the light we cannot see,' he, in what was in many instances only a page and a half, or even only half a page, has written cohesive chapters that are richly dense, brimming with cerebral atmosphere that envelopes the reader at the turn of every page. in this regard, i could see marie-laure's loneliness, and werner's moral conflict. i felt the fear and uncertainty in jutta, daniel leblanc, and etienne's reticence. i could taste the saltiness in the breeze that wafted over saint-malo, while also i could smell the acrid, grey, and gritty skies of zollverein. each time a character was famished due to scant war rations, i tasted the sweetness of the cool water they drank and i could taste the crust and crumb of the loaf of bread they tore apart. these are not things easy to achieve in books. doerr however has done so fantastically.it goes without saying that there is plenty beauty and radiance to be found in 'all the light we cannot see.' some of it emanates directly from the characters, while other times, it comes from the reader's own willingness to be open-minded. taking that into mind, there were only two minor concerns i had with the novel. first being that when the author went into descriptive details of radio repair and engineering principles, my eyes would on occasion glaze over a bit since neither subject matter are strengths of mine. nevertheless, as a curious reader, i know that it was necessary for me and other readers to know werner's technical acumen when the author painstakingly described the workings of transmitters, transceivers, and the intricacies of repairing electronics.the second minor concern i had with the novel was the very last chapter, which covered the year 2014. so that i don't inadvertently give spoilers, i will simply say that i would have liked this chapter better if it was written differently. i loved the significance of it and the observations made, but i would have liked it better minus the game playing grandson. also, i would have preferred the scene take place during a final visit to saint-malo rather than where the scene is depicted. even better would have been if this very last chapter had been cut altogether. ending the novel on the previous chapter labeled ""frederick,"" would have had a better impact in my view.despite the minor misstep in the last chapter, 'all the light we cannot see' is superb all around and i absolutely recommend it. i also want to point out that unlike some readers, the back and forth narrative depicting differing timelines and differing character perspectives did not bother me one bit. this is a technique that i appreciate and think it is one of the reasons why this novel is so special. readers who complain about this non-linear technique must challenge their ability (or lack of it) to retain multiple levels of story details as the plot progresses. for serious readers who like their books to have weighty, loaded implications, and for readers who appreciate intelligent writing that give literary gifts every turn of the page, 'all the light we cannot see' is for you. read carefully and ""open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever."" 5 stars!",17-08-2018,1501173219,9,10,11.98,4.5,anthony doerr,2014,historical

all the light we cannot see: a novel,brilliant historical fiction,debbie,5,"all the light we cannot see by anthony doerr has been discussed so many times on social media, i'm not sure i can add or say anything more that hasn't already been said. i thought the book was different and exceptional, and i can fully understand how it won a pulitzer prize. from the story itself, to the characters contained within, i thought it was brilliant. i know several readers did not like the constant change in time-line, but for me, it left me in suspense and turning the pages. for those who haven't read it, it's the story of a 16 year old blind girl named marie-laure and werner, a young german boy and their perspectives and experiences in france during wwii. i have read a lot of wonderful fiction centering around wwii, but this book is unique in its storytelling and writing. i have to say for several days i found myself unable to begin another book. i just didn't want to let go of the characters. i can't say i was completely happy with the ending, but such is life. all i did was bend my spouse's ear for days about the book. i think he was happy when i finally moved on. to care about a book that much says a lot about the writing.",14-10-2023,1501173219,3,10,11.98,4.5,anthony doerr,2014,historical fiction,anthony,doerr,2,14,10,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,9
all the light we cannot see: a novel,an intimate retelling of a story you think you know!,momlovesya,5,"right away we meet ‚Äúthe girl‚Äù- 16 year old marie-laure leblanc who grew up in paris and lost her sight at the age of 6. she is the only daughter of a widowed father, daniel leblanc who works at the museum of natural history as the locksmith prior to the german occupation of paris. and we meet ‚Äúthe boy‚Äù- 18 year old german private werner pfennig who grew up in zollverein, a coal mining town 300 miles northeast of paris. we are alongside adolescent werner and his younger sister, jutta, when they find a crude radio which he begins to dissemble and assemble because ‚Äúnothing he‚Äôs encountered before has made so much sense‚Äù. the reich learns of his aptitude with electronics and invites him, at 14, to attend jungmanner, a military training camp for the best and brightest where he is instructed to ‚Äú. . . eat country and breathe nation.‚Äù he is described as ‚Äúthis snowy haired dreamer plucked out of the soot‚Äù.the author uses alternating chapters to reveal the back story of each character and to bring each character eventually to the walled city of saint-malo. in one story, the germans occupy paris so marie-laure journeys with her father as a last resort, to stay with her great uncle etienne in a house, number 4 rue vauborel, which is also richly detailed. in our parallel story, the boy, werner is currently stationed at the hotel of bees, saint-malo, as an electronics expert monitoring the airwaves listening for planes.present day in this novel is two months after d-day with half of western france free from german occupation. saint-malo however is the last citadel for the germans and residents fear there may be a thousand or more germans ready to die for their cause. four years of occupation and now, a real sense of urgency. the author describes leaflets dropped by planes to warn residents to find shelter or leave before an impending airstrike. marie-laure's father is being held somewhere though and she decides to wait for his return. the bombers plan to cross the channel at midnight. those chapters describing the present, ratchet the growing concern of the citizens of saint-malo as the reader meets many of the neighbors and townspeople who become real citizens of action. we learn of past broadcasts from the radio tower with its ingenious cabling as we listen in on present day broadcasts- the reading of jules verne's ‚Äú20,000 leagues under the sea‚Äù.werner waits in the basement of hotel bees monitoring the radio. marie-laure waits for her father‚Äôs return in her third floor bedroom with two tin buckets filled to the brim with water and the bathtub on the floor below filled as well (in recent months there have been instances of water shortages).there is also a rare, 133 carat blue, priceless diamond, ‚Äúthe sea of flames‚Äù and a perfectly scaled model of each structure and street on saint-malo.the ny times review had this to say about werner. ‚Äúas the words of his teachers fight the power of his memories, an inner voice tells him, 'open your eyes and see what you can see with them before they close forever.‚Äù this resonates so strongly with the reader because in our parallel story, marie-laure navigates by touch and then by memory.throughout the story powerful images resonate- night-time readings over the radio, john james audubon sketches, canned peaches, barnacles, a boiling frog. how does it happen that werner ‚Äúwhen he opens his hand, there is a little iron key in his palm.‚Äù?so, who should read this book?this book is perfect for readers who love geography. the place itself is fascinating; the reader can see in pictures of the walled city of saint-malo a natural isolation brought on by the tides. this was ‚Äúthe brightest jewel of the emerald coast of brittany, france‚Äù prior to the german occupation and it's easy to see why they continue to hold on to it.this book is perfect for readers who love historical fiction. the pivotal event of the story is well documented. the book provides an insider perspective to the events of the day, eyes on the ground so to speak through the observations and movements of werner combined with those of the whelk and the blade. the book has been criticized for glossing over the hardships of war. i‚Äôm not sure i agree; the wartime hardships here are intimate, personal.this book is perfect for readers who love familiar literature drawing parallels or individual observations about ‚Äútwenty thousand leagues under the sea‚Äù and the fate of captain nemo.this book is also for readers who like to read aloud; some of the chapters are short like diary entries and the novel is presented in an extremely readable format.what does the title mean?the first thing that comes to my mind when i think ‚Äúall the light we cannot see‚Äù is marie-laure‚Äôs inherent hope and optimism. she waits for her father, she ventures out, she takes action, she lives her life in spite of her handicap. she encourages this feeling in those close to her. for me, this light expands beyond marie-laure to include the good in her uncle, neighbors, friends, werner, jutta. we read of small and large acts of courage, of defiance, of hope.the light in the title is also a topic werner hears discussed on a late 1930s radio broadcast about the brain‚Äôs power to create light in darkness (coal mines, blackouts, blindness). the phrase ‚Äúopen your eyes and see‚Äù pops up in several different places in the novel. conversely the author writes, ‚Äúto shut your eyes is to guess nothing of blindness‚Äù.and if ‚Äúlight‚Äù is truth, there are many examples where we are confronted by lies- the letter from marie-laure‚Äôs father, the letter from werner to jutta, and where characters decide to hide the real truth or not to interpret it correctly.notable quotes:‚Äúopen your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever‚Äù (pages 48-49).‚Äúthere are, he assures her, no such thing as curses. there is luck, maybe, bad or good. a slight inclination of each day towards success or failure. but no curses.‚Äù‚Äúis it right to do something only because everyone else is doing it?‚Äù, jutta.‚Äúthere must be order. . . the entropy of a closed system never decreases. every process must by law decay.‚Äù (page 240).‚Äúdon‚Äôt you want to be alive before you die?‚Äù, madame manac (page 270).‚Äúoffering a loom on which to spin his dreams.‚Äù (page 389).‚Äúi wake up and live my life‚Äù, marie-laure (page 468).",23-03-2015,1501173219,10,10,11.98,4.5,anthony doerr,2014,historical fiction,anthony,doerr,2,23,3,2015,Spring,1,N√∂tr,Pozitif,1
all the light we cannot see: a novel,carried away to another world,sharelle moranville,5,"(warning: contains spoilers)anthony doerr‚Äôs 2014 novel all the light we cannot see is a story of survival, courage, sacrifice, suffering, family, friendship, love, hope, and survival. it‚Äôs set in france and germany during ww ii.how many thousands of novels does that thumbnail description fit? (jaded publishers and others in the business are starting to think of such novels as just another ww ii book, which might account for some of the tepid reviews the novel got before it circulated through the wider reading community.)all the light we cannot see is one of the richest, most readable, discussable, and likeable ww ii novels ever. yes. likeable. a narrative of war and suffering and death becomes a hopeful hymn about family, kindness, potential, magic, love, and mystery.doerr brilliantly shows us the specifics in the general: the character so unique and real that the reader can become the character. and thus we can truly cloak ourselves in the potential for individual goodness in the storm of a world gone mad. we learn and are comforted by how we might behave in a similar situation.in the final analysis, the story belongs to marie-laure, the little blind girl with the father who keeps thousands of keys for the national museum of natural history and is a gifted woodcarver. in both paris and saint-malo he carves tiny, clever models of their neighborhoods, which marie-laure must memorize with her fingertips. then by counting grates, benches, streets, and tapping her other senses for cues, she must show him she can navigate their neighborhood. he also teaches her to use her cleverness to unlock tiny objects to find the treasures inside. to this reviewer, those incredible miniatures, made in such a rush by a father for his vulnerable six-year old girl as the germans draw near, are the most unforgettable takeaways of the novel. and as her world is going up in conflagration, marie-laure‚Äôs fingertips race across the braille dots to open another world, the world of twenty thousand leagues beneath the sea, which she broadcasts as the bombs fall. marie-laure, with her blindness, has a huge capacity for the world and human experience.then there is werner, a german boy, whose snowy white hair is almost as much a character marker as marie-laure‚Äôs blindness. he is an undersized orphan trying to look after his sister and others in the industrial area of zollverein, germany. werner has a preternatural gift for mathematics and radios and, as a result, is spared going into the mines, but is scooped up into the german army where he becomes a radio operator.marie-laure and werner cross paths when the allies begin bombing the holdout of saint-malo in early august, 1944. during the most intense part of the circular, reiterative narrative, werner is trapped in the basement of the hotel of bees because of a bomb hit. marie-laure is trapped not far away in the attic of her uncle‚Äôs house with the cursed jewel, the sea of flames, in her possession. a mad, dying nazi stalks the downstairs desperate to get at the jewel, which he believes will save his life.thankfully, doerr lets a long, comforting resolution play out as we see what happens to the survivors of the bombing of saint-malo. we see the survivors intermittently as they go about life-after-the-war until 2014 (the novels pub date). so vicariously was i participating in this novel, if i should go to paris this year (fat chance), i would keep an eye out for an elderly blind lady who seems to know where she is going. and i do believe some evil potential, buffeted and stained to look like ordinary sea rock, is always being swished around on the ocean floor waiting to be found and polished.doerr expands the literal plot line (this-happens-then-this-happens-then-this-happens) with a richness of inversions, paradoxes, oxymorons, juxtapositions, repetitions, symbols, and motifs that invite the reader to go beyond the storyline. for example:‚Ä¢ clearly, a mollusk is not just a mollusk. and what‚Äôs with all those birds?‚Ä¢ before two of the most heart-breaking events of the narrative (the rape and werner‚Äôs death), why are there quasi-eucharistic events?‚Ä¢ why is the fabulous diamond, the sea of flames, given such an oxymoronic name?‚Ä¢ how can we not see light?‚Ä¢ why is twenty thousand leagues beneath the sea the message of comfort to all who hear marie-laure‚Äôs last broadcast? (on the surface, it would seem to be an inversion of the usual message of hope.)‚Ä¢ why can the story be read pretty effectively backwards?doerr‚Äôs story has become an earwig. certain images, characters, events, and themes will always remain in my head. more than any novel i‚Äôve read in years, i felt that i was buried with werner below the hotel of bees. i was in the cold orphanage attic with him when, as a boy, he listened to a faraway voice talking about the nature of light on the radio. i was as hungry as marie-laure contemplating opening the last unlabeled can of food in the attic.as an adult who has read a gazillion novels, i‚Äôve largely lost my childhood ability to be carried away into another world by a story. so thank you, anthony doerr, for letting me do that again.",23-02-2017,1501173219,5,10,11.98,4.5,anthony doerr,2014,historical fiction,anthony,doerr,2,23,2,2017,Winter,1,N√∂tr,Pozitif,3
all the light we cannot see: a novel,one of my favorite reads this year!,lee,5,"i find this review a bit difficult to write because honestly, i don‚Äôt know where to start! all the light we cannot see is like no other book that i‚Äôve read before. on its surface, this book is about a young german boy with a talent for fixing radios and a blind french girl who possesses a curiosity and courage way beyond her years ‚Äì both thrown helplessly into a world torn apart by war and devastation and the impact this has on their lives. but this book is so much more than that! it is about survival, love, courage, family, friendship, etc but on a deeper level, it is also a ""study"" on human nature and what it means to ""do what is expected"" versus ""do what is right.""the author anthony doerr has a masterful way with words ‚Äì the richness in detail with which he describes every character / event / scene in the book paints a vivid picture of what life was like in the midst of war, yet he does so in a manner that does not take away from the story itself. he does not bog the story down with long, tedious paragraphs or pages and pages of detailed description that make readers like me want to just skip ahead to the actual story and not bother with the details. instead, he uses brevity as a powerful tool ‚Äì in just a few words, short phrases, sometimes not even complete sentences, he is able to bring to life not only his characters and the situations they encounter, but also draw the reader into their world to experience it for ourselves. as i was reading, i actually felt like i was being transported back to that time period (mid 1930s to 1940s), walking alongside the characters, seeing what they were seeing, feeling what they were feeling. the atrocities of war described in the book were very harsh and very real, despite this being a work of fiction. i actually winced during some of the parts where an atrocity was being described and had to set the book aside for a few minutes to calm myself. i‚Äôve read other books in the past about his time period, about world war ii and the atrocities of war, but none of those books had the impact this one did. thinking about it now, i realize why: those books either use wwii merely as a backdrop without going into much detail or if they do, the events are portrayed in a way that makes it feel like a story or a recounting of history ‚Äì as a reader, you are told what happened during that time period but don‚Äôt really feel a connection to it. this book, in its uniqueness, actually makes you live that history rather than just read about it.the other unique aspect to this book was the storyline involving the cursed stone, which brought an unexpected element of suspense that still blended in perfectly with the rest of the story. in the hands of a less capable author, incorporating this part of the story might ruin the book entirely, but with doerr, this is definitely not the case ‚Äì he is consistent with the details as well as the storytelling and incorporates this arc seamlessly throughout the book. i found myself at the edge of my seat at certain points wanting to find out what happens next -- whether the stone would be found, whether certain characters would get caught, etc. i enjoyed this part of the book immensely!my only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù about this book would be in its structure, as the story is told in different timeframes and switches back and forth after every couple chapters. this interrupted the flow a bit and did slow me down at times when reading, since i had to go back and re-read certain parts in order to remember where the previous timeframe left off. it also caused a little bit of confusion for me initially with some of the characters who were already part of the story when the book opens but then are introduced for the first time when things switch back to the earlier timeframe, then it picks up with what happens to that character from the later timeframe when it switches again. not a show-stopper by any means of course, but i think the book would‚Äôve been easier to get through if it didn‚Äôt switch back and forth. i'm pretty sure there was significance to structuring the book this way but unfortunately it was lost on me.despite this long review that i just wrote, i actually don‚Äôt feel like i did this book any justice. in fact, no review can do this book much justice because it is a book that can‚Äôt just be ‚Äúdescribed‚Äù -- you basically have to read and experience it for yourself. for me personally, i loved this book and i know this is a story that will stay with me for a long time to come. i can totally see why this book won a pulitzer prize ‚Äì absolutely well-deserved!(read in january 2017)",18-08-2017,1501173219,7,10,11.98,4.5,anthony doerr,2014,historical fiction,anthony,doerr,2,18,8,2017,Summer,3,Pozitif,Pozitif,3

the ballad of songbirds and snakes (a hunger games novel) (the hunger games),this is not a hero story,anne pruitt,5,"4.5 starsamazon delivered my copy early, so i'm going to do a spoiler free review and then a spoilery one. pardon if this winds up sounding like an english paper. i have thought so much on the morals and questions in this book that i feel like i should have read this in school.note: i'm writing this review with the express belief that you, reader, have at least read the book description. otherwise why are you reading this review?i want to start this off by saying two things. one, this is not a hero story. snow is never once, in my opinion, shown to be a hero in this in what we modern folks would call a hero. he's no luke skywalker or redeemed villain. this isn't some sob backstory to explain ""why the bad guy is bad."" this is yet another set of layers to the onion that is snow.second, this book is dark. it's been a minute since i read the original trilogy, but i swear it wasn't quite as graphic as this book was. cannibalism is mentioned, and it's shown/talked about that someone sawed the leg off a dead woman and ran off with it. one character is killed then hung on a hook and paraded. another is also gruesomely displayed after their death. several characters are dragged through processions to ""prove a point,"" another character is hung from two large poles and left to basically die in the sun. multiple accounts of vomiting/poison throughout, and a general unpleasantness at the lack of regard for human life.non-spoilery review:this book makes you think. a lot. it makes you question things, and wonder if maybe snow is right (he's not), but it's written in such a way that he's not a villain. donald sutherland in an interview made a great point in saying that snow isn't a villain, he's just a ruthless man doing what he thinks is right to keep his home and country in one piece.""he does it so well. and he doesn't think he's a bad person. he thinks it's the only way society can survive. and whether you think he's right or wrong, he doesn't think he's bad. he likes himself.""this should be the mantra for this book. snow is a conflicting, flawed human. in our society, he's evil, a sociopath or a psychopath. he's a murderer and a killer. he's a bad guy. in his world, he's one of the masses. he simply lives as he's been raised to, with a mentality that has been ingrained in him since the war between the districts and the capitol. he's simply more ruthless then most and has the guts to make what he considers the ""hard decisions.""regardless of the other characters in this, they're all props to his story--which fits well with the snow we know from the hunger games. everyone is second stage to snow and his life. this is his evolution from being a child to a man, to becoming the snow we know and love/hate.i definitely don't think this book is for everyone. i'm sitting here with my mom breathing down my neck because she can't wait to read it, and i don't think she'll like it at all, and she's a diehard thg trilogy fan. why? because not everyone likes to read depressing books. there's no redemption in this. there's no saving someone from themselves. this is the fall, stumble, plummet into being a not great person and embracing it fully.so take that as you will. full spoilers below about everything.p.s. this is a standalone.spoilers belowokay, so, i was worried about this book when i read the first chapter sample and it got announced that snow would be training the district 12 girl. i thought, oh crap, it's gonna be a cliche ya. it's gonna have a stupid romance that undercuts the whole plot and makes him a sap. and yeah, it did that, and up until the last 50 pages i was teetering on a 3-3.5 stars. and then oh boy, the end.lucy grey was a sweet girl, but she felt off since the beginning. i still can't fully put my finger on it, but her and snow's relationship felt so <i>wrong</i> the entirety of the book. the red flags went up repeatedly every time he made comments about how she was his, and even so far as to say she was his property, and that's all kinds of wrong. and even though their romance was cute and fluffy, it felt bad, tainted. you knew something was going to happen. it always does in these villain backstories. usually the whole reason the villain is bad is because the love interest gets brutally killed and then they're like whelp, guess i'll just be evil.not in this book.snow constantly struggles with morality and right and wrong throughout this. should he turn in his friend to the capitol because they're colluding with rebels and could tear down the (flawed) infrastructure? or should he turn a blind eye and let his friend do his own thing? is the hunger games wrong or good? is it wrong to view the district people as second class humans? and so on. this book broaches the topic of racism in very broad terms with the whole district/capitol thing. you've always known there was a divide between them, but in this, you really see how much the capitol looks down on the districts, and you can easily see how that morphs into such a hatred and distaste by the time katniss first enters the hunger games.but i digress. snow struggles with morality, but he's flawed and very, very imperfect. he rationalizes every death he takes as self-defense or some other reason when really he's just murdered someone because it's inconvenient for him. he kills (or at least removes her from the picture; it's ambiguous) lucy grey in the end because she's a loose end and too free. he does it. not someone else, not some freak accident. he chooses to do it and, by the time it happens, you already know what direction he's headed in so it's not quite another nail in the coffin. it fully feels like him tying up loose ends so he can go do whatever he wants.all the nods to thg characters and names was cool. you also had a lot of the great gatsby vibes in the old money versus new money mentality that a lot of the capitol had with district people who gained a fortune and bought their way into the capitol life. they're looked down upon by the old families and viewed as trash.you saw a lot of the evolution in the hunger games, and you can see how it begins to change and grow into what katniss and peeta suffered through. you see how it begins to change from a simple punishment to a sport and a holiday, with the growing encouragement that it should be a normal and good thing.you also see a side of the capitol you most definitely did not see in the trilogy--suffering. a lot of the book shows snow struggling with having been a small child living through the dark days and the war. he was 8 when the capitol won, and even then it was hard. you learn about the hell the capitol lived through as they were besieged by the districts' army and forced to ration, starvation, and cannibalism. it's a hard picture, and it's so blatantly told. collins didn't hold back any punches in this. i never felt like what was done was for shock and awe for the reader, but it was definitely that for the story, and it made sense. regardless of the capitol not being at war with the districts anymore, the tensions were still so high that it makes sense for the capitol to overreact in their retaliation of events. so when one mentor gets killed by her tribute, they shoot the tribute and parade her body around on a hook at the mentor's funeral. it's disgusting, debasing, and shows how much the capitol views the districts as nothing more than rodents or livestock.anyway, i'll stop talking. go read it yourself. it's a hard read, a heavy read, but it was very, very enjoyable.",24-05-2020,1339016575,6,11,10.99,4.6,suzanne collins,2020,"adventure, war, science fiction, romance, action, thriller",suzanne,collins,7,24,5,2020,Spring,2,Negatif,Negatif,0
the ballad of songbirds and snakes (a hunger games novel) (the hunger games),"ted bundy, coriolanus and the joker",mj,5,"the ballad of songbirds and snakesas most readers already know, this prequel explores coriolanus's life when he was a teenager. the opening chapters reveal that he was also chosen to be a mentor for lucy gray who was from the despised district 12.but what she lacks in fighting skills she makes up for being a charismatic performer. lucy gray learned how to work a situation to her advantage.in the beginning the tributes did not enjoy capitol luxuries but were kept in cages and barely fed. it‚Äôs a stark contrast to the future hunger games when tributes were met with an extravagant welcome and dined on rich foods.the problem was that watching too much brutality turned the capitol away from the games. snow's addition to the hunger games of costumes, interviews, and the underdog tributes made the propaganda go down easy. this should be a cautionary tale.a lot of readers are not getting the point the author is trying to make. in the opening of this book there's a quote by hobbes:‚Äúhereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man.‚Äù ‚Äî thomas hobbes, leviathan, 1651coriolanus's first ""lesson"" to be molded into the future oppressor was during the hunger games; when he was forced to go in the arena to get out sejanus, one of the mentors, who was not supposed to be in there. while at the hospital getting stitches, the head gamekeeper, dr. gaul, asked if coriolanus understood what he was supposed to learn.‚Äúwithout the threat of death, it wouldn‚Äôt have been much of a lesson,‚Äù said dr. gaul. ‚Äúwhat happened in the arena? that‚Äôs humanity undressed. the tributes. and you, too. how quickly civilization disappears. all your fine manners, education, family background, everything you pride yourself on, stripped away in the blink of an eye, revealing everything you actually are. a boy with a club who beats another boy to death. that‚Äôs mankind in its natural state.‚Äù‚Äúi think i wouldn‚Äôt have beaten anyone to death if you hadn‚Äôt stuck me in that arena!‚Äù he retorted.‚Äúyou can blame it on the circumstances, the environment, but you made the choices you made, no one else. it‚Äôs a lot to take in all at once, but it‚Äôs essential that you make an effort to answer that question. who are human beings? because who we are determines the type of governing we need. later on, i hope you can reflect and be honest with yourself about what you learned tonight.‚Äùa very similar thought process was also stated by the joker in the dark night:‚Äúto them, you‚Äôre just a freak, like me! they need you right now, but when they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll cast you out, like a leper! you see, their morals, their code, it‚Äôs a bad joke. dropped at the first sign of trouble. they‚Äôre only as good as the world allows them to be. i‚Äôll show you. when the chips are down, these‚Ä¶ these civilized people, they‚Äôll eat each other. see, i‚Äôm not a monster. i‚Äôm just ahead of the curve.‚Äùboth the joker and dr. gaul has distorted thinking. it's one thing to make a choice freely and it's quite another thing to be forced into one.human nature is such that coercive enforcement of rules is indispensable to protect the rights of all but there is a fine line between government rule and government oppression.later, as coriolanus's feelings toward lucy gray grew, he helped her to survive the games only to get caught and was sent to train with the peacekeepers in her district. sejanus joined him there soon after.sejanus was never one who was comfortable with the capital and its way of life. he got a plan to help the districts by providing the rebels with guns for their flight up north, out of panem.coriolanus found out about sejanus‚Äô plot. mayfair threatens to tell her father [the mayor] everything, which would implicate coriolanus and lucy gray despite them being only bystanders; he shot her.sejanus is charged with treason and hanged. and lucy gray baird is the main suspect in billy taupe [her ex rebel boyfriend] and mayfair‚Äôs deaths, as he left her for the mayor‚Äôs daughter.in desperation, lucy gray decides to join the rebels up north and coriolanus decides to go with her, thinking there's nothing left of his life once the murder weapons were found.but as they prepare to flee district 12, snow gets paranoid that lucy gray is betraying him. when they stop at a house near district 12‚Äôs lake, he discovers the rebels‚Äô store of the weapons. when lucy gray takes a long time to cut up some katniss plants, he convinces himself that she has abandoned him and went to turn him in.""what if they interrogated or even tortured her? the story would come out. she hadn't killed anyone. he had. his word against hers"".but even though snow searches for her, lucy gray was nowhere to be found.the three killings that snow did throughout the book contributed to his downward spiral and ptsd. coriolanus clubbed to death a tribute, bobbin, in the hunger games arena. he also shoots the mayor's daughter and also turns in his best friend, sejanus, for treason, resulting in his execution.lucy gray was the last straw for his sanity. back at the capital the reader sees snow's change to ""the dark side"".""sometimes he would remember a moment of sweetness and almost wish things had ended differently. but it would never have worked out between them, even if he‚Äôd stayed. they were simply too different. and he didn‚Äôt like love, the way it had made him feel stupid and vulnerable. if he ever married, he‚Äôd choose someone incapable of swaying his heart. someone he hated, even, so they could never manipulate him the way lucy gray had. never make him feel jealous. or weak. livia cardew would be perfect. he imagined the two of them, the president and his first lady, presiding over the hunger games a few years from now. he‚Äôd continue the games, of course, when he ruled panem. people would call him a tyrant, ironfisted and cruel. but at least he would ensure survival for survival‚Äôs sake, giving them a chance to evolve. what else could humanity hope for? really, it should thank him.""this happened to ted bundy as i believe one of the main reasons he became a serial killer was because his first love dumped him. if you were to get all his victims lined up together you would think they were all sisters and you will notice that they all look like his first girlfriend.rejection is a powerful force in a person's life if they are not stable. dr. gaul planted the seeds for that rejection to take root and grow.",25-07-2020,1339016575,6,11,10.99,4.6,suzanne collins,2020,"adventure, war, science fiction, romance, action, thriller",suzanne,collins,7,25,7,2020,Summer,3,Pozitif,Negatif,0
the ballad of songbirds and snakes (a hunger games novel) (the hunger games),a fantastic villain origin story,holly,5,"i adored the hunger games series. dystopian ya is not a normal genre for me, but this series is awesome and this prequel? a fantastic villain origin story.coriolanus snow is an ambitious 18-year-old student whose wealthy family barely survived the war. he is all about image and pretense, which often vie against his normal, human feelings. his parents are dead and he lives in a rundown apartment with his grandmother and cousin tigris.but, the 10th hunger games is to be the first one with mentors and coriolanus has been chosen to mentor the female tribute from district 12. while at first humiliated at not being given a more highly rated district, he quickly realizes that lucy gray is someone who could win and it's up to him to figure out how to help her do that. along the way, coriolanus learns about love and the dangers it can bring.as he works his way through the games, he also discovers who wields the power in the capitol, who controls the games and what he needs to do to rise up above the masses.the student mentors also have a say in how the games are run, and in a somewhat twisted sort of way, their professor gives assignments and in coriolanus' essays, we see how future games come about and evolve. as the mentors talk about the games and what is happening, we also see how they are not all unfeeling or unkind. they view their tributes as people and they can see how unfair the games really are. at the same time we see that those in the capitol are only concerned about their well being and that their losses are because of the rebels.the hunger games series is vibrant and colorful in its imagery. this book, however, was almost more black and gray in its imagery, what with the rubble of the arena and the capitol still trying to rebuild from the war. that made the contrast of lucy gray's colorful skirt and the snakes all the more striking.as with the rest of the series, we see the government oppression, we see the results of war and rebellion. we see society broken, but fighting and we see that even with survival, life isn't grand and colorful. but we also see that the human spirit is strong.no one likes who president snow becomes and i think writing about his story so that he gains the reader's sympathy is brilliant. the story isn't fast-paced, but it drew me in and kept me enthralled.",09-09-2023,1339016575,5,11,10.99,4.6,suzanne collins,2020,"adventure, war, science fiction, romance, action, thriller",suzanne,collins,7,9,9,2023,Autumn,3,N√∂tr,Pozitif,3

lessons in chemistry: a novel,chemical reaction retraction,crafty consumer,4,"much has been said about bonnie garmus's lessons in chemistry. so when my sister chose it for our book club, i was curious, albeit cautiously.elizabeth zott is a brilliant and beautiful chemist in mid-century california. she seems to have everything going for her, but ""seems"" is the operative word. because the men she works with are awful. what's more, elizabeth isn't like other women, or even people. unflinchingly driven and uncompromising, she refuses to perform for anyone, to smile on demand or at all. she tells the truth, even when it's ugly -- and it often is --making her seem uncooperative, unlikeable, and cold to everyone but nobel prize-nominated fellow odd duck calvin evans. yet at her core, elizabeth is purely kind. despite having suffered loss, violence, and the most egregious sexual discrimination imaginable, she believes that everyone deserves to be treated fairly. and it is this humanity that she brings to her cooking show, supper at six.now, if you're wondering how a no-nonsense chemist became a tv star, then i'm right there with you. suffice it to say that unjust events in elizabeth's life resulted in this most unlikely of developments. and although she's less than thrilled to be working with bowls instead of beakers, she makes the show her own, taking every opportunity to educate her female audience about not just cooking but chemistry and, ultimately, change. subversive and surprisingly entertaining, supper at six is a syndicated smash. to me, this is where elizabeth blossoms, her paradoxically off-putting personality, passion for science and food, and insatiable hunger for justice commingling to enable her to connect with other women. it's exciting and inspiring and all of the things. but this is still lessons in chemistry, not an uplifting romp about a reluctant but charismatic performer. because as i said in the beginning, elizabeth zott does not perform.there's trouble brewing at the tv station, just as there was at the lab, only worse. so some things happen, and then some more things, culminating in an ending that feels like a drop off a cliff. and although i can see how it would be satisfying for most, to me it's anticlimactic. still, this isn't my story; it's elizabeth zott's. she's a scientist first and in the end, she gets what she wants and needs.maybe understanding -- and respecting -- that is a lesson that this very unscientific but very feminist reader needed to learn.",03-11-2023,038554734x,3,17,15.37,4.6,bonnie garmus,2022,"fiction, historical fiction",bonnie,garmus,3,3,11,2023,Autumn,4,N√∂tr,Pozitif,1

"a court of thorns and roses (a court of thorns and roses, 1)",bow down to the queen of ya fantasy,teisha @ girl writes reviews,5,"this book, with its magic, fairytale roots, and steamy hot romance, deserves all of the stars. i loved it!here are the five reasons why i gave a court of thorns and roses 5 out of 5 stars (and then some):‚òÖ fairytale retellingi was a little wary of this story when i discovered that it was a fairytale retelling. i love the story of beauty and the beast. growing up, i watched the disney version all of the time (but not as much as i watched pocahontas). however, in the past i have struggled to find enjoyment in beauty and the beast retellings. particularly beastly by alex flinn -- i did not enjoy the book or the movie.i think i was worried that a court of thorns and roses wouldn't feel original, but it was the complete opposite. maas has written an incredibly unique story that is grounded in the fairytale we all know and love, but is also independent and utter creative genius (maas is definitely honing and owning her writing skills!). yes, there is a curse, and magic, and a love story. but there is also dark magic, and steamy romance (and i do mean steamy!), and blood and gore, and court drama -- basically, all of my favorite things wrapped up in one neat, rose-colored bow.there were some twists on the original story of beauty and the beast that i really enjoyed. for example, in the original story, the residents/servants of the beast's home are cursed and transformed into household items. however in acotar, rather than being transformed into household items, maas' cursed characters must wear masquerade masks, and have done so for 50 years since the curse was placed on the night of a masquerade party. i also appreciated that, though tamlin was a beast, that quality did not factor into the curse that was placed on him. rather, as a fae, he has the power of shape-shifting, and takes the form of a beast (usually when fighting). so, throughout most of the book, tamlin is portrayed as a glorious, chiseled, man of steel. some readers believe that the fact that tamlin is gorgeous retracts from the beauty and the ""beast"" story line. however, no one writes hot male love interests like sarah j. maas, so i am not complaining about tamlin at all.overall, i found that i loved the fairytale background of this story more than anything. i enjoyed drawing comparisons between maas' story and characters, and the story i grew up with. maas' world is so intriguing, engrossing you from the very beginning and never letting you go.‚òÖ genrewhile we know that acotar is a fairytale retelling, that is not to say that it is a children's book. i went into this book thinking that it was young adult. however, there is a particular scene that takes place after the great rite on fire night (such a good scene, by the way -- just wait for it) that made me take a step back and think ""whoa! this is way too sexy and erotic for young adult literature.""looking back at goodreads, i found that the book was listed as young adult and new adult. but, i would personally classify this book as new adult. having read many new adult novels, i found that the sex rating for acotar resonates with that of a new adult novel. i think that there is a lot of confusion about the genre of this book because we all know sarah j. maas as a young adult author. i personally have no problem with this genre. however, for parents who are giving this book to their young children, or for those readers who don't enjoy sex scenes in their books -- you have been warned.i love the new adult genre, and discovering that acotar fell into that genre made me love it even more. i appreciate the more mature content, and that the characters are closer to my age (feyre is 19). and, hey, i appreciate the sexy times, too. (there is no shame in my game... because, who am i kidding? i have no game.) i had also never read a new adult fantasy before, so i was glad to be exploring new territory.i'm absolutely impressed with maas as a writer. she is not afraid to be different, to venture out to new places. i love that she is entering this new genre, and look forward to seeing what else she has up her sleeve for the future.‚òÖ feyre, the protagonistwhen i started reading acotar, i was sure maas was going to give us another celaena sardothien: a badass girl who is nearly invincible, yet lovable and cool. however, feye (pronounced fay-ruh) is so different from other fantasy protagonists i have read, because she is so unapologetically human. she is normal, and she is flawed, and i found that i could easily relate to her character. feyre is unlike the female protagonists we are accustomed to. she is no fighter, not outstandingly gorgeous, and she is also illiterate (a shortcoming that embarrasses her to not end).in the beginning, feyre is not very likable. she is cold, harsh, stubborn, and hard-headed. but, readers begin to see how her situation of poverty has shaped her to be that way. once at the spring court, where she is no longer burdened with the responsibility of taking care of her father and two sisters (all of whom are ungrateful of her efforts to keep them alive), the ice in her heart begins to melt as she lives in comfort and takes up her passion for painting. readers witness her character develop as she begins to rediscover happiness and life's simple pleasures. feyre easily becomes a character you can't help but root for and love.‚òÖ tamlin & an impending love trianglesince we have discussed feyre, i believe that it is only appropriate to take a glance at her love interest: tamlin.tamlin is a bae fae warrior, with magical abilities. he is also gorgeous, kind-hearted, and strong. and, he places feyre's happiness and well-being above all else. but, he is not perfect. he is flawed, haunted by his family's past, by his own mistakes, and the lives he has taken. but, through all of that, he still strives to do and be good.however, i admit that while i love tamlin, i am worried that maas has a love triangle in the works for book 2 of acotar.because rhysand.rhys, a sexy, dangerous fae, is a force of nature who seeks to dig his claws (or rather, talons) into feyre. and, i can't say that i hate him. i actually like his character, although we witness him do some terrible things (even to feyre). he seems edgy, fun, and is incredibly witty. (maas does this thing where she makes you fall in love with all of her characters, even the morally ambiguous ones.) while tamlin is all gorgeous and good, rhys has that hot-but-tragic thing going for him.i am already struggling with the love square maas has going on in the throne of glass series (between celaena and her three love interests -- chaol, dorian, and rowan). i don't think that i will be able to handle the emotional roller coaster of another of her love triangles. but, i think that as long as no one else is introduced, as long as this does not move into the quadrilateral stage, everything will be fine.‚òÖ supporting characterswhile maas' main characters are at the center of attention, her supporting characters keep this book afloat. with less focus and fewer appearances, maas' supporting characters still manage to steal our hearts and the show.first, there is lucien, the red-haired, one-eyed fae who is tamlin's best friend. he is initially rude to feyre, but eventually warms up to her. they easily develop a sort of big-brother-little-sister relationship. i would consider lucien to be the story's comic relief. he is humorous and sarcastic and i adore his character.there is also amarantha, the story's evil villainess. she is a fae ruler who has a particular hatred for humans, which is not good for feyre. she is cold, calculating, and cruel. but she has a backstory (all the best villains have backstories). and, i don't want to spoil you all, so i will just say that, when you learn her backstory, you realize why amarantha is so harsh and unforgiving. although, while i can sympathize with her on some level, i find her evil ways to be too much at times. however, i still find her to be an interesting, well-written character.and of course, there is rhysand, whom i mentioned earlier. he is incredibly important to the story of book 1, and will have an even larger presence in book 2. i cannot wait to learn more about his character, because he is so enigmatic and intriguing and i just know that i am going to love him.honorable mentionsmaas' writingi believe that acotar is maas' at her best. as i stated earlier, we are definitely seeing maas hone and perfect her skill -- each book she releases is always better than the last. what i liked most about maas' writing in acotar was her use of first person. throne of glass is written in third person, and with changing character perspectives. i find that i can tend to get bored with certain characters. but, with acotar, told from feyre's perspective, i felt engaged throughout the entire book.faerie worldi literally want to live in prythian, in the world of the fae that exists beyond the wall (just without all of the drama). maas depicts the spring court so beautifully and vividly. it seems like a literal heaven on earth.other than the beauty of the fae world, there are the parties and festivities. i mentioned fire night and the great rite earlier, two very interesting festivities held in the fae world. and then there are parties and gatherings celebrating the seasons, such as summer solstice and midsummer. it is all so fantastical and fun, readers are just dying to step into the pages.***there is not much else i can say about a court of thorns and roses. i loved this book! i have no idea how i am going to wait an entire year for the sequel. it's going to be excruciating, but i am sure that it is going to worth it. because sarah j. maas is a fabulous queen of writing, and every word she writes turns to gold.",05-10-2015,1635575567,8,23,8.89,4.6,sarah j. maas,2015,"fantasy, romance, young adult, fiction, new adult, fae",sarah,j. maas,8,5,10,2015,Autumn,4,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0
"a court of thorns and roses (a court of thorns and roses, 1)","not a perfect book, but a good book 1.",kindle customer,5,"i bought the trilogy. all together they were the best books i've read in a while. separately, they were not perfect but i'm okay with that. i read a lot and tend to dislike books that show no character growth, or have wishy-washy villains, or have insta-love, or have love result from h saving h from sexual violation, or suffer from deus ex machina. i don't particularly care if something is obvious because sometimes i want to read something that is easy and obvious. my brain doesn't want to be challenged 24/7. also, i love good dialogue- dialogue makes a romantic connection feel real rather than insta-lovey. is dialogue action-packed? no. does it slow down pacing? you bet. at this point, you're probably wondering where this review is going? well, i think that knowing more about me as a reader might make it easier to see/ relate to my views for this book.now the fun stuff! ***spoilers***feyre (the h):this character is complex and goes through several changes throughout the series. in this book, she has her ups and downs. initially, she is hardened, street-smart and capable with a cynical eye toward romance and happiness and outright hatred and prejudice towards the fae. she also has love for a family who seems to dislike and neglect her. she is not very likeable. but does that make a book bad? no. (hello, wuthering heights.) it is, however, more rare to write an h this way because readers in general tend to want to relate to an h, particularly when it's written in 1st person perspective. so many readers might not be able to get into the story because of their dislike for feyre. when the far remove her burdens that largely drove who she was, feyre changes. she doesn't have a purpose to keep her going, to shape her. the pacing of the book suffers a bit here while she tries to sort herself out. she tries to make love and painting her new purposes, and while she has the determination to do so, the fit just isn't right. does this make the book bad? no. while many people won't like to read about an h that seems somehow ""less"" this downward arc was necessary to fuel the inevitable reversal toward a more fitting purpose. it drags a bit for sure, but makes the reversal feel more right, more true later on. did she rush into something with tamlin. her feelings do feel a bit rushed but ultimately fit her as a character- going all-in has always been her style from the start. in that sense, the character is consistent. also, her reluctance to voice her love made me think that deep-down she might have confused love with gratitude. tamlin was her savior in many ways. for all of these reasons i liked feyre.tamlin (the h):tamlin was the 1st high fae feyre had any meaningful interactions with in the 1st book. i never really liked him as an h. he was pretty but basically hollow. he struggles with uncontrolled rage. he had just as much hatred for humans as feyre did for fae, and his elitist attitude was hinted at throughout this book (though not substantiated until book 2). he also adheres to fae tradition in weird ways- his willing participation in the fire night ritual is distasteful because it borders on infidelity (especially since we later learn in book 2 that he can designate a replacement). tamlin has from the beginning been primarily focused on tamlin. when things get tough, he sends feyre away; he doesn't consult or listen to her, but just decides, hinting at his desire to treat her like a possession rather than a person. when he gets a moment of freedom under the mountain he attempts to have sex with feyre (his wants) instead of trying to escape with or save her (her needs). when feyre is dying, he can only bring himself to beg for her life, he isn't moved into action. all of these things hint that tamlin is not a good fit for feyre. many readers will not like to read about an h that is so lacking/ ill-fitted. the beautiful part is that these things are only ever hinted at in the writing, not outright stated so you will want to root for tamlin while also feeling something inexplicably lacking in him. i thought about it lots before i picked up book 2, where my thoughts regarding tamlin were cemented. tamlin could not have been written more likeable though. if he was the perfect h then feyre falling for rhys in book 2 would have felt like a betrayal, instead of fated, and then feyre would've been worse than unlikable but detestable as an h.lucian:a secondary character who is both interesting and flawed. he hates feyre at first, but ultimately warms up to her. he is loyal to a fault, siding with tamlin over and again, even when he thinks it is wrong to do so. a trait that becomes more obvious as the series progresses. lucian has potential.rhysand (villain/other h):rhysand was the most interesting character in the book (although nesta was a close second). rhys was the evil queen's right-hand man. he has done terrible things. yet, when we meet him (not my favorite bit of the book because of the gross circumstances i do not favor, as mentioned above) there is evidence that he is not all that he seems. he appeared to be interested in feyre romantically, but the ""why"" part is not there. also, it is not 100% certain what drives his actions. he is a mystery. why did he decide to help her time and again? why, if he likes her did he decide to put her through nightly humiliation? why use her to torment tamlin? he is clearly not 100% a good guy. he is complex.other things people often talk about:the sex. there is a lot more sex in this book than in other ""ya"" books. it seems like that has somehow lead to some amount of controversy. i find that notion very strange as many eons ago when i was a teen, sex was a big part of being a teen- whether or not to have it, who had it, when they had it where and how, what type of birth control to use, etc. suggestions that a book would have any type of influence on those things are just silly. teens have sex. it's a fact. wishing it otherwise does nothing productive. also, the sex in this series is not ""explicit."" every time i see this adjective used, it makes me laugh. i have read many romances and even some erotica. if you truly want something ""explicit"" check out erotica- phrases like ""the apex of my thighs"" or the ""the length of him"" are not ""explicit.""the copious dialogue. lots of readers don't like the extended dialogue and also wish to have seen more of the fae world. i am just guessing here, but i am thinking that they are meaning that they wanted less talk and more fairy magic. but, fae are known for more than just their magic. another key attribute of fae has to do with their words- being able to only speak in rhyme, only speak the truth, answer any question posed, etc. this attribute can be very interesting (see mortal instruments series or dresden files). and indeed it was put to use throughout the series, sometimes well done other times much too dues ex machina for my liking. dialogue can be a type of action when done well enough. in this book, it probably could've been better but was good enough for me.the fire night and rape culture. honestly, i am bothered by this one. i am never fond of rape or sexual violence as a plot device which is why i tend to avoid historical romances almost entirely. in this book, i think the fire nite ritual was used in part explain a bit about fae magic and in part to push forward the feyre-tamlin relationship while introducing rhys. i think it both went too far and not far enough. tamlin's participation cheapens his feelings toward feyre, just imagine someone saying, ""i love you, truly, but i need to go have sex with someone else."" and then he came back to feyre after having sex with someone else, and bit her to clearly show his possession of her. it doesn't sit well, does it? additionally, the three fae with bad intentions suggest to feyre that fae tradition gives them the right to violate her just because she is present. that makes all fae seem brutal and detestable. thus, it goes too far. but, what about the converse? the fire night ritual is supposed to be necessary to ensure the bounty of the land for the next year. but, the spring court is the only court that has/ observes this ritual en mass? that does not really make sense to me. the need for this ritual, especially considering mated bonds are a rare and extremely valued thing, is not properly explained. it really could've been omitted from the book and is one of the few things about the book that i truly did not like.the masks. some people like them, some don't. the reason given for them was that they were yet another obstacle to a human girl falling in love with tamlin. i really didn't mind them but i did not like feyre's reaction to the removal of the masks. while it was consistent with her character (she always had an eye for pretty guys), i thought that it cheapened her character to have her feel relieved that tamlin was so pretty without his mask. it was very superficial, and further proof that there wasn't much of substance to their ""love.""while book 1 is my least favorite of the series, i still really liked it and will definitely re-read it again. books 2 and 3 get even better and i am looking forward to further writings as well. hopefully we will get to see what happens to nesta, elaine, the 6th queen, and bryaxis.",02-10-2017,1635575567,9,23,8.89,4.6,sarah j. maas,2015,"fantasy, romance, young adult, fiction, new adult, fae",sarah,j. maas,8,2,10,2017,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,2

"a court of thorns and roses (a court of thorns and roses, 1)",beautiful cover,ohlookabunny,4,"having heard much raving about this series, i was poking around on amazon when i saw this collector's edition. it is indeed gorgeous, although i do wish it had a ribbon attached to the book to use for a bookmark. the gold image that flows from the front cover to the back and the texture of the cover are far more appealing than the plain, paper, black covers that are on most hardbacks today, and that alone justifies its presence on the shelf. it wasn't the first time i had bought a book for the cover.aside from hearing reviews from fans, i also saw a reference to the book when reading about patricia a mckillip's _winter rose_, which i had recently read, and its connection to the ballad of tam lin. this same fairy tale apparently had influence on holly black's _tithe_, also. although the high lord in maas's tale is named tamlin, the story is obviously a retelling of ""beauty and the beast."" the story also has borrowed pages from the fairy tale ""east of the sun, west of the moon,"" wherein the main character is taken away from her family by the bear, and the bear prince makes her impoverished family rich. whereas neither ""beauty and the beast"" nor ""east of the sun, west of the moon"" have fairy characters, aside from a witch or enchantress here and there, in the story tam lin, he is identified as an elf. in maas's retelling, which court is cursed to wear masks, tamlin's friend's mask is clearly stated as a fox, whereas tamlin's mask is only vaguely described, and he is often referred to as a ""beast."" the lack of description was a tad infuriating.while set in a fairy tale period of time past, the main character clearly has ""modern"" ideas. she has no mother and a weak father figure and, furthermore, was tasked by her dying mother to take care of her sisters, despite the fact that she is the youngest. the family has only recently fallen into poverty, and the main character's upbringing has been neglected. she learns to hunt to feed the family, and, unlike the book-loving belle of the disney fairy tale, no one bothers to teach her how to read, although she is presented with a library, at which point, if you were ever in doubt as to which fairy tale was being emulated, you now know for sure. according to the internet, the character's name ""feyre"" means ""fair, beautiful,"" like the name ""belle."" dyswsdt? i myself am not a fan of retellings, and even less of ""modern"" retellings, although i do appreciate influences and notes here and there.as a novel, the story has a single plot line. i have always felt that a story can be a single plot line told in a linear fashion, but a novel requires a bit more substance. although it was interesting enough for me to finish, i am not sure that i feel compelled to read the rest of the series, particularly if there is no matching collector's edition. for me, the most interesting parts were the three tasks at the end, and i had already guessed the answer to the riddle. i found feyre's modernity and rebellion to be tiresome and in direct contrast to what readers who like fairy tales would desire, and i found her difficult to like, which is basically how i feel about most ""strong female characters."" i do not understand how a person who is stubborn and illogical is strong. stubborn, i can get. stubborn and dumb at the same time? no.acotar has a lexile score of 880, which puts it at the lower end of a 4th grade reading level (700-1160). you won't learn any new big words, and the prose is clearly more commercial than literary and follows the ""hero's journey"" template little to no deviation (i.e., no big surprises). it is known near the beginning of the book that the main character is no virgin, and there are racy scenes past the middle of the book, as well as being intoxicated and hints of something like a lap dance while being scantily clad in later chapters. the descriptions of the fairy land (not merely a realm) were not as detailed as those in julie kagawa's _the iron fey_ series and were mundane and too similar to the lands of the mortals. the writing was a bit awkward at several points where one character's actions were in the same paragraph with another character's dialogue, so there was a bit of a whiplash effect for the reader, and the book could have used a good editor to clean up those areas. so, was it bad? obviously not that bad, since i finished it. will i read more of her stories? i can't say for sure, but probably not unless they issue an attractive collector's edition worthy of the bookshelf. it satisfied my curiosity, but for fey-related books, i recommend jim butcher's dresden series and julie kagawa's iron fey series. both have mind-blowing descriptions and intricacies. i'm always interested to read other authors and series that would do a better job on this topic just to see if it's possible. so, i gave it three stars for being ""okay"" plus one for a really nice cover.",19-07-2023,1635575567,2,23,8.89,4.6,sarah j. maas,2015,"fantasy, romance, young adult, fiction, new adult, fae",sarah,j. maas,8,19,7,2023,Summer,3,Pozitif,Pozitif,8

"a court of thorns and roses (a court of thorns and roses, 1)",acotar is nothing more than erotica,anne pruitt,2,"so here i sit, having gone through the omg acotar series is amazing phase, and out the other end, i can sit back and think ""what the actual hell?""i'm a huge maas fan, so when i found out she was writing another series, i had to have it. for the first time in a long time, my library actually got the book within a month of its release, so i checked out acotar and read it in a single day. i loved it.books two came out, and while i was super disappointed in the pointless sex thrown in every so often and whole chapters dedicated to this nonsense, i continued reading because the story was compelling enough. and then acowar emerged, and everything changed.this was a series i read numerous times before acowar came out, and i saw things that genuinely bothered me, but i ignored them (i don't even know why) until i just couldn't stand it anymore.acotar is nothing more than erotica. i feel like the series as a whole started out with plans of being some sort of ""story"" porn that has a kick-ass plot with ""hot"" scenes thrown in for whatever reason, and then it got to acowar and decided it wanted to be the bachelor or a soap opera instead.the relationship between tamlin and feyre greatly disturbs me. she's taking care of her family and he swoops in after she accidentally kills a fae (who was disguised as a wolf int he woods where hunters hunt...) and takes her away, claiming she's going to be in trouble and damned and blah blah. no, she's pampered and given servants and pretty clothes and good food. tamlin dresses her up like a doll and makes snide remarks when she falls short of his goals (fae goals, mind you).feyre is a human. tamlin is fae. he acts like her humanity is a curse or something to hold against her, and he constantly makes remarks about how she's too fragile, too uneducated, too plain, etc. instead of ""fixing"" these issues, tamlin does nothing other than tell her what to do and not do.he sexually assaults her after calanmai, and in the book feyre shows how much she does not want his advances, and he shoves her against the wall and bites her, then tells her not to ever go against him again. how is this ok? if my husband ever did this to me, i'd kick him in the crotch and leave. this is not ok. this is not a relationship. this is abuse, which is why it disgusts me that people go on and on about tamlin.the fact that feyre and tamlin have sex at a later time after he did this makes it worse. why, feyre, are you going to throw yourself at a man who a) doesn't care about you based off his degrading comments and b) threatens you. not only that, he basically blames her for a near-rape experience when he literally did nothing to look out for her and/or stop the guys who were going to attack her?that being said, i have a lot of issues with feyre. she gets off too easy on everything, and it's like her brain is only wired to care if the dude is hot. you take care of your family, but then you walk into tamlin's embrace after the things he has said and done. i understand she has been abused by this, but at the same time, she could have said no. death is a lot better than basically being a sex slave or punching bag to an immortal person determined to imprison you until you die.she's never punished for killing a fae. lucien and tamlin tell her about magical creatures that could give her what she wants, and the next day she walks out and finds them...the elusive creatures...that are hard for fae to find?lucien is about the only well developed character, and he's too sexualized sometimes for me to take me seriously. if you keep pointing out the abs, tanned skin, or whatever on the dude, you're turning them into a slab of meat. all of the males, and truthfully the females as well, in acotar are ""perfect"" in the idea of what today's society thinks is beauty, sexy, and amazing at everything. this is sexist on every account. your characters become nothing more than fantasies--which is why i say this is nothing more than porn/erotica.sure, you can get some great messages out of this series, but is it worth all of the dung in the way? specifically with the later books, there's too much sex at some points for it to even be ok. please, go try to have sex that many times or for days on end and tell me how that is. if you can do that, i'm sorry, but you're either a whore or you're just kinda crazy, because that's too much.why i ever read this book and like it, i truthfully don't know, but i'm done with this series. i'm done with this fandom, and i'm fed up with seeing people ""swoon"" or make comments or even draw/like at that nude art about literary characters. guys, seriously? this is not a book for young girls, but when i went to the first (and last) maas event, most of the audience there were between the ages of 14-20 (predominately 15-17 years of age) and screamed when maas was mentioning sex scenes. i'm not going to continue to support a series that is encouraging young teens and young women to have unrealistic ideas of men as well as sexual fantasies, especially the married women who i've seen act this same way. if i were your husband, i wouldn't be able to deal with that. i wouldn't want those books in my house.about the only good thing i have to say for acotar was that there actually was a plot in this book, and it was good, if insanely slow to get rolling, and the amount of sex was fairly minimal.",13-11-2018,1635575567,6,23,8.89,4.6,sarah j. maas,2015,"fantasy, romance, young adult, fiction, new adult, fae",sarah,j. maas,8,13,11,2018,Autumn,4,N√∂tr,Pozitif,3

the curse ‚Äì while not particularly a fan of the fact the curse made tamlin and his court all have to wear masks (since i really thought it would have been better if they all had to remain in animal form) i did like the final symmetry and cruelty of the curse. it was different and i totally respect that, it was a truly fae curse in the level of cruelty behind it.‚úß rhysand ‚Äì was my favorite character and i‚Äôll totally admit i‚Äôm still not sure what exactly i think of him. i will say this though, he is the most interesting character in the book whether he is playing on the side of good or evil‚Ä¶.well you will have to make your own decision on that. but i seriously hoping the next book is about him.as this is the start of a new series i will give it some leeway at getting started. there are some really fun parts to the story and even though it is a bit clunky at times i still got to a point when they are ‚Äòunder the mountain‚Äô that i needed to get through the story to see how it all worked out and this is where the story mostly stayed on the like side of the line.the stuff that missed the mark:‚ú¶ - when writing about a well-established lore i think there are some things that perhaps the reader will ‚Äòaccept‚Äô or ‚Äònot accept‚Äô based on how important or ingrained it is or the story the author puts with the lore change. based on my various readings there are a few things about fantasy creatures that are ingrained into me. i know that‚ûú vampires ‚Äì drink blood, can‚Äôt be in the sun and die by a wooden stake through the heart‚ûú werewolves ‚Äì silver bullets, shifting (of some kind), full moon‚ûú fae ‚Äì immortal tricksters, can‚Äôt lie‚ûú zombie ‚Äì human dead, eat fleshi‚Äôm not going to say the maas changed the fae lore so much that she *stephanie meyer‚Äôd* it but she pretty much made a change to the fae lore equivalent to making vampires sparkle in the sunlight. it isn‚Äôt quite a deal breaker for me, but i‚Äôm not a fan of that particular lore twist either.‚ú¶ it pains me to say this but feyre and i didn‚Äôt get along until about 75% of the way through the book. she does so many stupid things that honestly i went from really liking her in the very beginning of the story to being completely annoyed with her.she began strong and independent with a family to support and i really liked that she wasn‚Äôt your typical virgin heroine. she hunted for her family and was the main supporter. not conventionally educated she still came across as bright and strong.after ending up in tamlin‚Äôs court and promising to stay the first thing feyre tries to do is escape, when tamlin assures her that he has seen to her family‚Äôs comfort she pouts and tries to find a way to escape again. she puts herself in dangerous situations without much thought in these attempts and really it was slightly tiresome.‚Äúweren‚Äôt you warned to keep your wits about you?‚Äù tamlin snapped. ‚Äúthat your human senses would betray you?‚Äùhe stepped beyond me and let out a snarl so vicious that whatever the thing was by the gates shimmered with light and darted out as fast as lightning streaking through the dark. ‚Äúfool,‚Äù he said to me, turning. ‚Äúif you‚Äôre ever going to run away, at least do it in the daytime.‚Äùi liked her a little more after she calmed down and decided to stay but the damage was done and she never made much headway with me again until toward the very end of the book when she became much more likable.‚ú¶the curse ‚Äì( yes i know that it is up in the like part as well, you get +5 points because you noticed) - the story made it seem like it was so horrible to be cursed to wear the masks but honestly i thought it made tamlin hotter instead of diminished. masks are sexy i don‚Äôt care who you are just think about it zorro, phantom of the opera, a slew of superheroes and‚Ä¶.the dread pirate robertstamlin had a beast form so i thought it would have worked possibly better if she had to fall in love with only his personality. just an opinion.‚ú¶the ‚Äòrite‚Äô ‚Äì there is a moment in the book where there is a spring festival. i‚Äôm not a prude i swear but it really bothered me how that played out. the whole scene made me feel a little strange and i really wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with my feelings about it. maybe if i knew some other fae stories and knew that was what ‚Äòthe rite‚Äô of spring was i wouldn‚Äôt have minded but i was not prepared. on a good note i was happy that it didn‚Äôt have any negative residual affects between feyre and tamlin.overall thoughts:sometimes at the beginning of a new series you can‚Äôt see the big picture and that is why the first book of it might fall a little flat for you. i will say that when i read throne of glass it was just an okay book for me as well but then i loved both crown of midnight and heir of fire. i‚Äôm hoping that is also the case with this series.based on how the book ended i have some really high hopes for the next book of this series. if you like fairytale retellings or faerie stories then i say still give this one a go. if anyone can deliver a stronger second book to a series it is maas so i‚Äôm not concerned and think she could be off to a solid start.begs sarah j. maas to have the next book be about rhysand and dare i hope for it..‚Ä¶.nesta",08-05-2015,1635575567,7,23,8.89,4.6,sarah j. maas,2015,"fantasy, romance, young adult, fiction, new adult, fae",sarah,j. maas,8,8,5,2015,Spring,2,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0
"a court of thorns and roses (a court of thorns and roses, 1)","detailed to an excessive degree, but plot is good.",adrea crosby,4,"i‚Äôve read books 1-3 in this series, and despite the plot being great (especially between the two main lovebirds in book 2), i don‚Äôt plan to keep reading. the chronic excessive explanation with surroundings in the environment and feelings, almost worded as if taken from poetry books to a point of where it doesn‚Äôt even make sense sometimes, just keeps taking away from enjoying the plot already. i just want to get to the point of what matters between characters, and though it‚Äôs normal to have it drawn out in most fictional relationships to keep the suspense, this series just did it too much for my liking. took way to long for the story to finally bring to light what the heck is going on between az and mor, only for it to not even be that ‚Äúout there‚Äù of a reason, they‚Äôve existed for hundreds of years and still haven‚Äôt found a way to talk about her real reasons for not wanting him? poor az, that‚Äôs just damn cruel and cowardly of mor. this is a great series, but it‚Äôs definitely for the younger mind. when the interesting scenes between the 2 main lovebirds starting getting less and less‚Ä¶interest to read last two books gone. there were a lot of gray areas between the different characters relationships, in a way my mind got tired of trying to figure out how they really perceive one another. 4 stars because the plot is still good, not 5 because the depth of connection between characters felt constantly side tracked instead of being put first.",26-10-2023,1635575567,9,23,8.89,4.6,sarah j. maas,2015,"fantasy, romance, young adult, fiction, new adult, fae",sarah,j. maas,8,26,10,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,8
"a court of thorns and roses (a court of thorns and roses, 1)",doesn‚Äôt deserve the hate,shay,5,"okay so... i might lost some of my favorite critics over this because i know a lot of you weren‚Äôt a fan of this book. and i have some pretty intense feelings about some of the biggest criticisms lmao. i will talk about some flaws with the book still, as no book is perfect. but for the most part i really loved it. there will be rants. i have alot to say. sooo here we go before i lose my nerve lmao.my main petty annoyance: the fact that tamlin uses his paws the same way a human uses hands even when he‚Äôs in beast form lol. there i said it. now let‚Äôs move on to hopefully not my most controversial review ever. i feel like i‚Äôm supposed to hate maas and her writing. but i don‚Äôt. i really love what she did here.characters:feyre:i really don‚Äôt get the hate. maybe she gets worse later. maybe. but people hate her in this book too and i don‚Äôt get why. she was meh to me. i admired her in some ways and hated her in others. i loved her heart, and how often she let it guide her even if it resulted in her ignoring everything anyone told her. which yes- did annoy me sometimes. but it wasn‚Äôt that bad.now we get to the fun part.tamlin and rhyes (similar thoughts on both)-oh my god. the reasons you guys hate this dude are absurd in this book. every single thing i was told to look out for and that would start me into hating him was ridiculous. i genuinely believe you guys just don‚Äôt ship him and feyre so that makes him immediately sooo horrible. same for the rhyes haters.you guys have to stop inserting in a fantasy setting and acting like any of the decisions made are simple. both of them are great in their own way- and both had feyres interest in mind in my opinion. the questionable things they do, because yes there are some...are either for show to save feyre and everyone else. it‚Äôs all so obviously calculated and here you guys are trying to critique it like they‚Äôre events that happened over tea in a totally normal world with nothing intense or life threatening going on around them. just why.i‚Äôm team rhys just because i like him a little more- and i love the way he thinks and speaks. but i also love tamlin and am still rooting for him to be happy.i think they‚Äôre both fleshed out brilliantly and have many layers that i can‚Äôt wait to uncover. they both have scars and they both have really unfortunate situations that are eating away at them that make them who they are. i‚Äôm just saying... think about the alternative that could happen if they didn‚Äôt make some of their questionable choices.they wouldn‚Äôt have done half the stuff they did for this one human... if they didn‚Äôt truly care.villain-well she‚Äôs like not very nice lol so of course i don‚Äôt like her and i‚Äôm not rooting for her but...idk i put her here because i did kind of have a problem with how stupid she seemed to be for someone who was supposed to be cunning. she let certain people get away with way too much, and didn‚Äôt seem to notice or care. it was strange because then she would just randomly turn into a brutal witch out of nowhere but then let certain things happen other times. i‚Äôm sure some of it was her calculating but... still. it seemed a little weak.she‚Äôs bitter, brutal and interesting. the ring, will probably haunt my nightmares. she just wasn‚Äôt as developed.lucien-i don‚Äôt want him with feyre but i just wanted to say... despite me liking tam and rhyes... lucien will forever be my babe. i love him the most. he‚Äôs so complex and he‚Äôs been through so much.he‚Äôs witty, intelligent, and overall just cares about people even when he pretends he doesn‚Äôt. i want nothing but greatness for him lol. his story is heart breaking as well.the rest- this story is filled with intriguing, misunderstood, and terrifying creatures. no complaints there.her family- feyres family is on my poop list. but i don‚Äôt hate nesta even now as some of you seem to. maybe i‚Äôm a mean bitter person... idk.the plot-like every plot it has both weak and strong points. i loved seeing the world unfold, and getting to see a good chunk of it before the action started.i did think the twist with the masks and how convenient all of the events were was well... convenient....while it did lead to the most exciting parts, i felt like the point of it was kinda glossed over and the explanation for why things were how they are wasn‚Äôt too important to the story.but it came over decently- and the ending wasn‚Äôt terrible. so i‚Äôm happy.i still got the magical yet unsettling experience i wanted. and i can‚Äôt wait to see more of this world.i really feel like it‚Äôs just the cool thing to hate maas and these books now. but i don‚Äôt see them as problematic as a lot of people seem to. i had an incredibly enjoyable time reading them, and i saw the reasons behind the words .think what you want about me because of that lol. i will not defend myself for not seeing the issues other people see. i will be continuing.",26-02-2021,1635575567,4,23,8.89,4.6,sarah j. maas,2015,"fantasy, romance, young adult, fiction, new adult, fae",sarah,j.

the four agreements: a practical guide to personal freedom (a toltec wisdom book),a trip into mysticism,j. m. alexander,4,"the four agreements by don miguel ruiz & the fifth agreement by don miguel ruiz and don jose ruiz i decided to ‚Äúreview‚Äù or ‚Äúsummarize‚Äù these books together because the fifth agreement is very much a continuation of the first book, and in fact reiterates much of the earlier text. both are based on the philosophy of the toltec, ancient people of southern mexico who were known as women and men of knowledge. before delving into the books, i should acknowledge that i found then somewhat difficult. although i have read a great many of what i would call ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù books and wrings in the recent years, these readings, although similar, were a bit more difficult to fully digest. the author at times anticipates such problems on the part of the reader, and is indeed accurate in that regard. the toltecs were not a race or tribe, or nation, but scientists and artists formed to explore and conserve the spiritual knowledge and practices of the ‚Äúancient ones‚Äù. they came together as masters (naguals) and students at teotihuacan, the ancient city of pyramids outside mexico city and known as the place where ‚Äúman becomes god‚Äù. the toltec recognize that some 3000 years ago a human studying to be a medicine man woke to the realization that everything is made of light and that all that exists is one living being, and that light is the messenger of life because it is alive and contains all information. he called the stars the tonal and the light between the stars the nagual, and knew what created the harmony between the two is life or intent. he saw himself in everything- in every human, every animal, every tree, in the water, the clouds and the earth. as i read the book, this seeing, this realization, is the truth, is pure love and pure light. it is this truth that we much search for. but why must we search if such truth is everywhere? we must search because we have lost the truth. when we are born devoid of language, we are the truth‚Äìour presence is a miracle. we feel and see what is, without interpretation or judgment. but, as we grow, we are what the author calls ‚Äúdomesticated‚Äù, just as animals are. the truth that we feel is replaced by symbols-words- that are mere illusions, that are opinions grafted onto objects and feelings. we apply our attention‚Äì the ability to discriminate and focus only on what we want to perceive- on these symbols. as children we believe what adults say, especially our parents, and our world becomes a dream, a reality built on symbols from others, not the silent feelings and observations that we experienced as infants. and this learned reality-our dream- tells us how to behave in society; what to believe and not believe; what is acceptable and not acceptable; what is good and bad; right and wrong; beautiful and ugly. we are imperfect because we do not measure up to an image of perfection that has been imposed on us by others. and we accept such law and structure by a system of reward for doing what is ‚Äúright‚Äù and punishment for doing what is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. this acceptance reflects a multitude of agreements we have made with our world. we are judged and punished and then punish ourselves for bad behavior. we become victims who carry guilt for such failures, and are punished again and again whenever we are reminded, or remind ourselves of such failures. we live in a dream ruled by fear and filled with emotions of anger, jealousy, envy and hate. we must be right and prove others wrong. our mind and our world become a fog‚Äìa mitote- a dream where a thousand people talk at once and no one understands. the author feels that, as a result, we are living in a dream of hell. we then search for the truth, for a way out of this hell. and yet, the truth is already within us, we don‚Äôt have to search, we just have to uncover what is part of us already, as it was when we were born. to escape our dream of hell, we must break the old agreements that are fear based and reclaim our personal power. we must create a new dream, our own dream- our personal dream of heaven. the author suggests four basic agreements that you must make with yourself to reclaim your own power and find a heaven on earth, a life of joy and fulfillment. the first agreement- be impeccable with your word. the author feels that this first agreement is the most important and powerful. i noticed a few things about the wording. first, he uses the singular ‚Äúword‚Äù, rather than ‚Äúwords‚Äù. i think perhaps this is in deference to the use of such term in the bible where john, speaking of creation, says ‚Äúin the beginning was the word, and the word was god, and the word is god.‚Äù through words you express your creative power. but he obviously means the plural, that your use of language must be impeccable. the use of ‚Äúimpeccable‚Äù is also interesting. our common definition of ‚Äúimpeccable‚Äù is faultless or flawless. but it also means incapable of sin or without sin. it is this meaning that the author employs. he feels that a sin is anything that goes against yourself, and being impeccable is not gong against yourself, taking responsibility for your actions, but not judging or blaming. he says that if one loves him or her self, then he or she will express that love in interaction with others, and will thus be impeccable with the word, because such word, such action, will produce a like reaction. he contrasts words coming from love with those coming from what he calls black magic. he feels that gossip is the worst form of black magic, for it is judgmental language about others, even those we do not know. it is emotional poison that we teach to our children and friends and loved ones through our use of such criticism. the word is too often used to blame, to criticize, to find guilt and destroy. he gives the simple example of a child being told by her mother to shut up her singing because her voice was ‚Äúugly‚Äù. the child obviously agreed with her mother, and thus made an agreement with herself not to sing any more. these are the type of agreements that we make in life that are harmful and destructive, that lead us into our dream of hell. instead, when you are impeccable with your words, they are no longer fertile ground for gossip and criticism, but for love. and as you use such words, first by expressing love for yourself, you break all the many agreements that make you suffer, and begin to build your own dream of heaven on earth. i don‚Äôt read ‚Äúimpeccable‚Äù to mean absolutely honest, for there are times when being absolutely honest could be counter to your words coming from love. the second agreement- don‚Äôt take anything personally. this is much easier said than done and i also think that the author assumes that one is practicing impeccability in their word before adopting this. he basically feels that people take things personally because we assume that things said are truly about us and that we are prone to believe them. in fact, he feels that people do not do or say things because of us, but because of themselves. also, whatever they do or say is a product of their own belief system, of their own personal dream. thus, what they may think about me is not about me but is about them. instead of accepting this, we resort to the need to be right, and show the other wrong, so we magnify the power of their words or deeds. if instead we always act from a sense of love‚Äìthe impeccability of our word- then if someone is mad at me, then i know that he or she is mad at him or herself and i am just the excuse for their anger. when you stop taking things personally you can keep your heart open and not be harmed. you will not need to trust in what others do or say, but only trust yourself to make responsible choices. and you must remember that neither praise nor criticism is to be taken personally because it is not about you, but the speaker. as i said at the outset of my comments on this agreement, i think, in discussing this agreement, that the author assumes that he is impeccable with his word. if not, then how could he say that when someone gets mad at you they are mad at themselves? this may still be true even if you were not using your word impeccably, but it would be harder to accept, especially since, in his discussion of impeccability, the author says that one must take responsibility for his actions. wouldn‚Äôt this mean that when we are less than impeccable that we must accept some consequence, but not punish our self endlessly? couldn‚Äôt someone‚Äôs anger be about us if our word was less than impeccable, but instead filled with the black magic mentioned by the author? i raise these questions in my mind because at times, as i read through this, it sounds as if one can ‚Äúget a pass‚Äù for less than sterling behavior because he need not take others reactions personally. i don‚Äôt think this is the author‚Äôs message, but it could be read into some of the philosophy. the third agreement- don‚Äôt make assumptions the author starts off his discussion with this statement: ‚Äúall the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personally.‚Äùalthough i would question the use of the word ‚Äúall‚Äù (i have a hard time with such broad statements like ‚Äúall‚Äù or ‚Äúnone‚Äù or‚Äúalways‚Äù or ‚Äúnever‚Äù), i basically agree with his statement, especially as it concerns emotional reaction to others. (true sadness from the passing of a child or similar ‚Äúobjective‚Äù tragedy is hard to relate to assumptions or taking things personally) i have found that people often assume my meaning, and sometimes take offense at something that was never intended to harm. they probably misunderstood, but, as the author notes, were afraid to ask for clarification and therefore filled in any uncertainty with an assumption. i don‚Äôt know exactly why we are afraid to ask for clarification, maybe it roots back to those days when we were reluctant to ask questions in school. maybe it a fear of being wrong, even if it is a subjective response to another. i don‚Äôt know why we do such things, but know that we do, and that it causes great and unnecessary pain. i think these two agreements about taking things personally and making assumptions are really part of a self centeredness that ‚Äúit is all about me‚Äù. we often tell people, ‚Äòit‚Äôs not always about you‚Äù , but such words are almost in jest. in fact it is really important to realize that it isn‚Äôt always about you, especially when the assumptions made generally do assume so and lead to taking things personally. not making assumptions would seem to be one of the easier agreements to live up to, as it only involves a little bit of inquiry. but, like any change, it requires practice. the author just suggests that you ‚Äúmake sure the communication is clear. if you don‚Äôt understand, ask. have the courage to ask questions until you are clear as you can be, and even then do not assume that you know all there is to know about a given situation.‚Äùgood advice. the fourth agreement is about the action of the first three- always do your best. the author stresses always doing your best, but knowing that your best will vary from one moment to the next depending on how you feel, etc. but, whatever your state, you must always do your best‚Äìneither less nor more. trying to do more than your best will cause you to spend unneeded energy and, in the end, your best will not be good enough. you must be motivated to do your best not by some expected reward, but by the love of what you are doing. doing your best will help with the other three agreements and it will also make you feel better even if you suffer failures in the other three. if you keep trying to do your best you will become a master of transformation-practice will make you the master. always doing your best requires a great deal of effort. if you break an agreement, then you must be willing to begin again the next day and try your best to keep such agreement. in reading the author‚Äôs comments on this fourth agreement i am unsure whether he is relating ‚Äúdoing your best‚Äù to life in general or to the application of the other three agreements. i see his book as being primarily focused on reaching an internal contentment and happiness, not on navigating one‚Äôs way through the world at large. admittedly, such inner contentment may well supply the path to successfully living in this rather complex world. i just find a bit of a contrast between the focus of this work and something like ‚Äúfalling upward‚Äù by richard rohr where he acknowledges the need to survive in the competitive world as a means of gaining some level of confidence before, in the second half of life, we are able to discard much of the baggage of the first half and seek out a more personal and spiritual contentment. of course, this may be my misreading of both books, but, that‚Äôs what an opinion is all about. i also see a basic similarity between the two, and among other spiritual pieces that i have read. all see western culture as imposing and espousing a very competitive, win/loose guilt ridden mentality. such mentality may or may not be necessary for the struggles that we face, but, all my readings seem to agree that at some point our thoughts need to focus on attaining a more peaceful and inclusive level of spiritual contentment. this is the truth that the four agreements challenge you to seek. the fifth agreement - be skeptical but learn to listen as the author has pointed out, we learn from symbols, and these symbols do not represent the truth, which is present in everything. symbols are people‚Äôs interpretations of objects and feelings and are not the truth, but are often lies. thus, it is important to be skeptical, but he adds that you must then listen. when you listen carefully to others you can then understand the symbols that they are using and understand their story‚Äìtheir dream. your communication improves and you can then see if what another is saying has relevance to you. you do not have to believe their story, for it is only symbols. similarly, you do not have to believe your own story, for it is just made from your symbols. neither story is the truth, the truth simply is, whether you believe in it or not. it doesn‚Äôt need you to believe, for it simply is. when you listen you don‚Äôt have to form or express opinions, you merely need to listen. by merely listening you show respect for the other person‚Äôs dream, for the reality he or she has created. the author sees all persons essentially as artists who create their worlds, and they must be respected as such. when we listen and share our stories, we try to understand them and make them part or our stories if we so desire‚Äìor not. if you gain control over your symbols then what is left is the real you, and the real you, not your symbols, makes your choices. in trying to summarize what the author is saying i find myself struggling at times to get to the crux of his message. i think that perhaps by expanding his work to this fifth agreement he intends to open the door to spread the wisdom of the four agreements to others. the first four agreements taught us that out symbols are not the truth, and that many of these symbols‚Äìour entire symbology as he calls it- are lies that lead us to blame and shame and guilt, to a living hell. the four agreements help us escape this personal hell, but perhaps there is more that we need to do. the author expands his discussion to outline the different stages that we go through as we try to reach our heaven on earth. he calls these steps ‚Äúattentions‚Äù. the first attention is the dream we create when we first use our attention to absorb the various symbols that we learn, and we then believe such symbols represent knowledge and our reality. he calls this first attention the ordinary dream of humans or the dream of the victims. it is a dream of victims because we are the victims of the false symbols which form our reality. and our reality is not about us, it is a mirror reflecting what others expect of us and for us. you must be freed of such reality and discover your true self. then we reach a stage where we realize that our dream is a lie and we use the attention a second time to try to change our dream and create a new one. this is the second dream of attention or the dream of the warriors because we now declare war against all the lies in our knowledge. it is a war against that part of our mind that makes all the choices that guide us into our personal hell. it‚Äôs a war between out true self and our belief system‚Äìwhat the author calls the tyrant or the big judge. in this battle we fight to throw off the belief system that causes us to repeatedly punish ourselves for past ‚Äúwrongs‚Äù- the system that brings up past thoughts and punishes us over and over again. the author notes that ‚Äúhumans are the only animals on earth who punish themselves a thousand times or more for the same mistake, and who punish everybody else a thousand times or more for the same mistake.‚Äùhe instead postulates that true justice is to pay once for every mistake. as a warrior, one fights to find his true self. the author then notes that the dream of the second attention ends when something very important happens, something called the last judgment. this is the last time that we judge ourselves or anyone else. it‚Äôs the day we accept ourselves just the way we are and everyone else just the way they are. when the day of our last judgment comes, the war in our head is over and the dream of the third attention begins. we move from the dream of the warriors to the dream of the masters. this is a dream of truth and respect and joy. it is that point where we come back to our real state, our divine self, where we fell a communion of love with everything in existence. when we learn that the symbols are not the truth, then we are left to simply enjoy life, as we did before the symbols ruled us. we experience what he refers to as a resurrection, and it allows us to be wild and free like a child, except that we have freedom with wisdom instead of innocence. at this point we don‚Äôt need to judge ourselves or others, we don‚Äôt need to be right, nor prove others wrong, and we can express love with no shame or justification and walk in the world with our heart completely open. this is the goal‚Äì a life of joy. these books express a philosophy couched in rather mystical terms‚Äìin dreams and symbols, attention and awareness. but its message seems quite similar to other philosophies and much that is discussed in the current realm of what i will call a new spirituality. it suggests a path to find our spiritual connectedness to all of the world around us, a realization that we are each a part of everything, and that everything is a part of us. it reveals truth as not as description or a concept, but something that simply is. as the author points out, the physical nature of a chair is truth‚Äìits name is just a symbol, a symbol that can take a myriad of forms. i think he feels that a concept like goodness is also a truth that is intrinsically recognized and internal, and not a product of a value system that is imposed on us by others. as is love, and beauty. as do many others, he lauds the innocence of childhood, a time when the truth is real before we become ‚Äúdomesticated‚Äù. he doesn‚Äôt condemn such domestication, he just says that it is because all of us have been indoctrinated and pass that knowledge on. but, at least to me, he doesn‚Äôt recognize such conditioning as being a necessary part of that portion of our lives when we must learn to cope in our world. i think that this is the message that richard rohr sends in ‚Äúfalling upward‚Äù. i can easily be misreading both, but, so be it. the striking thing, as i read numerous books and other writings, and watch speeches, is the basic consistency in the message of oneness and the need to abandon, at least temporarily, much of what we have ‚Äúlearned‚Äù in order to open our minds, or perhaps clear our minds, so that we can receive the gift of interconnectedness. whether this is termed as experiencing heaven, or nirvana, or ‚Äúoneness‚Äù is of no consequence. these are just names for a realization of our humble and insignificant position in a broader, more accepting, and more loving world than most of us witness day to day.",04-07-2015,1878424319,4,32,7.74,4.7,melissa

the four agreements: a practical guide to personal freedom (a toltec wisdom book),"this is not ""new age"" self help book! this book is based on modern linguistic theory and philosophical precepts.",i'm me me,5,"i should start off by stating my background. i am an undergrad student of philosophy and linguistics, a branch of the humanities. i also deeply love this series of books because of its obviousness and simplicity. it has personally helped me triumph over many, many challenges. this is why i decided to write a review here.there is a huge tradition of skepticism in linguistics, especially about how language is used in various cultures to create belief systems. a belief system is basically a set of instructions inside your brain based on language. these instructions help you navigate the stressful world around you so you can survive. we are psychologically wired to think our belief systems are accurate and experience deep stress if we find them to be inaccurate.the trouble is, our belief systems are always inaccurate. yes, i used the word ""always"" for a reason.without going deeply into the study of philosophy and linguistics, i will give you an overview here:philosophy - when you study philosophy, you study belief systems about how the world works and explore important questions like ""is there a god?"" or ""what is consciousness."" you may not be surprised to find out that philosophy majors have not come up with answers to these questions because there is always a case where we are going to be wrong or have a counter argument. much of the study of philosophy is the collection of vocabulary words to describe beliefs. they even have a mathematical component called propositional logic, where one takes sentences and reduces them to symbols and creates ""proofs"" but even prop-logic is under fire from academics for its complete inability to predict anything. in other words, it isn't the answer either.linguistics - when you study words and language, you realize that all our beliefs are based on language and this language can never ""touch reality"" in that language is just an arbitrary description of reality, posing as real. i believe miguel ruiz must have taken a linguistics course as well--as his first agreement attests to the power of language. the four agreements pulls heavily from saussure and derrida. both saussure and derrida (and many, many others) did work on how we form ideas in our heads based on language. the gist is this: we have something called a ""symbol"" in our brain which is composed of two parts: the word and the visual representation of the object (look up semiotics for further detail). these symbols are in our mind and work together to form meaning, then belief. the unfortunate thing is that they are entirely made up. it isn't real. our ideas of it aren't real.if you really want a deeper understanding on how linguistics has saturated our belief systems i recommend reading some of their academic essays or get rivkin and ryan's literary theory books. they are excellent and will take you further down the rabbit hole. most of the essays are dense but worth the effort!to simplify: scientists and academics in the millions have tried and tried and tried to find ""the true belief"" for thousands, maybe tens of thousands of years and we have not yet arrived at any truth. because of domestication, we think other people have it, but they don't! ""truth"" is defined as that which has the most predictive power. so far, mathematics, geometry, and physics has the most predictive power. our belief systems simply do not.so any beliefs about yourself can be true and they can also be false. we can't know. so why not pick something positive? if no one knows anything, then how can you even know anything?but you don't need to study this yourself. all you have to do is think back to your past self, let's say ten years ago. did that person have a belief system that you now consider to be faulty? how is that possible? what about your future self? will that person believe you have a faulty belief system? probably! how is this possible? how can you be so wrong? is it because you ""haven't learned?"" i highly doubt it!but we have to be right! we are right! at least we think we might be . . . maybe?the need to be right is so ingrained within us that we create a huge drama when someone contradicts our beliefs. we end relationships over it! we storm out! we write angry twitter updates.how this book has personally helped me:- no one person's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what i can do, even if this person is an authority figure- no one group's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what i can do- no one has a clear idea of who or what i am, not even me!- when people talk, they are telling stories. i don't have to argue. i don't have to fight. i simply have to listen. wow!- i cannot comprehend another person's dream. i can't mind read. i can't assume. i know nothing of their inner workings.- even scary, aggressive people are just telling stories.- i no longer have to feel ashamed about who i am or what i've done or where i'm going. it's not my job to assign a story to my life, or a judgment.- i no longer have to pretend to be something or hustle to gain love. i just need to love who is willing to love back. it's so simple.- i take all gurus, religions, indictments and gossip with quite a high level of benevolent skepticism, which allows me to be free from the fear that goes along with these stories.- i don't take myself as seriously as i used to.probably the most valuable of all . . .- i have a deep compassion for all people. we are all just stuck here together, trying our hardest and doing our best. i don't have to hate someone because their best wasn't up to some story i tell myself. i don't' have to insist they believe in my story. i can just smile and listen and do what i can.",25-04-2017,1878424319,19,32,7.74,4.7,melissa sweet,2011,picture book,melissa,sweet,2,25,4,2017,Spring,2,Pozitif,Pozitif,6
the four agreements: a practical guide to personal freedom (a toltec wisdom book),simple but deep philosophy with the grandest of aspirations,emily,4,"the book has the boldest of aspirations, attempting to be in the peer set of sacred religious foundations such as the bible. the author believes we create our own hell and, through practicing the ""agreements"" in this book, could instead create our own heaven. the core idea of reframing your mental state is well studied and backed up by science, but the degree to which these agreements fulfill such lofty ambitious is an open question. my take is that there's some wisdom that anyone could benefit from, but there's a cloud of poor editing the reader must pass through to access it.""the dream you are living is your creation. it is your perception of reality that you can change at any time. you have the power to create hell, and you have the power to create heaven.""agreement 1: be impeccable with your wordsimilar to the buddhist eightfold path ""right speech"". they mean speech that doesn't go against yourself. this is both negative self-talk as well as unkind words towards others, because that comes back against us* if i see you in the street and i call you stupid, it appears that i‚Äôm using the word against you. but really i‚Äôm using my word against myself, because you‚Äôre going to hate me for this, and your hating me is not good for me.* using the analogy of the human mind as a computer, gossip can be compared to a computer virus. a computer virus is a piece of computer language written in the same language all the other codes are written in, but with a harmful intent. this code is inserted into the program of your computer when you least expect it and most of the time without your awareness. after this code has been introduced, your computer doesn‚Äôt work quite right.* impeccability of the word will also give you immunity from anyone putting a negative spell on you. you will only receive a negative idea if your mind is fertile ground for that idea.agreement 2: don't take anything personally.like david foster wallace's ""this is water"", we have a rather selfish view that the world revolves around us. instead, we must love ourselves and refuse to take the ""poison"" others may inflict towards us.* even when a situation seems so personal, even if others insult you directly, it has nothing to do with you. what they say, what they do, and the opinions they give are according to the agreements they have in their own minds.* even the opinions you have about yourself are not necessarily true; therefore, you don‚Äôt need to take whatever you hear in your own mind personally.* all the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personally.agreement 3: don't make assumptions.we view the actions of others through a filter. instead, we can practice mindfulness and accept things as they are without associating baggage.* we make assumptions about what others are doing or thinking ‚Äî we take it personally ‚Äî then we blame them and react by sending emotional poison with our word.* we only see what we want to see, and hear what we want to hear. we don‚Äôt perceive things the way they are.agreement 4: always do your best.in every moment, give it your best. even the seemingly inconsequential you now give your all. but note this is not about perfection, we are human and can accept our actions as long as we try our best.* when you overdo, you deplete your body and go against yourself, and it will take you longer to accomplish your goal. but if you do less than your best, you subject yourself to frustrations, self-judgment, guilt, and regrets.* if you don‚Äôt judge yourself there is no way you are going to suffer from guilt, blame, and self-punishment.* when you always do your best, you take action. doing your best is taking the action because you love it, not because you‚Äôre expecting a reward.* when you do your best you learn to accept yourself. but you have to be aware and learn from your mistakes. learning from your mistakes means you practice, look honestly at the results, and keep practicing.* you do your best because you want to do it, not because you have to do it, not because you are trying to please* i make everything a ritual, and i always do my best. taking a shower is a ritual for me, and with that action i tell my body how much i love it.quotes that provide a summary of the author's views* the best way to say, ‚Äúthank you, god,‚Äù is by letting go of the past and living in the present moment, right here and now. whatever life takes away from you, let it go.* the real you is still a little child who never grew up. sometimes that little child comes out when you are having fun or playing, when you feel happy, when you are painting, or writing poetry, or playing the piano, or expressing yourself in some way. these are the happiest moments of your life ‚Äî when the real you comes out, when you don‚Äôt care about the past and you don‚Äôt worry about the future.* develop awareness of all the self-limiting, fear-based beliefs that make you unhappy.* you achieve the mastery of transformation by changing the fear-based agreements that make you suffer, and reprogramming your own mind, in your own way.* going to the core of those agreements is what i call going into the desert. when you go into the desert you meet your demons face-to-face. after coming out of the desert, all those demons become angels.* happiness is a choice, and so is suffering.",17-01-2021,1878424319,9,32,7.74,4.7,melissa sweet,2011,picture book,melissa,sweet,2,17,1,2021,Winter,1,Pozitif,Pozitif,10

how to know a person: the art of seeing others deeply and being deeply seen,an important book on an important topic taking a much needed skill building focus,j.m. ryan,5,"david brooks is good at both reporting and synthesizing best current thinking. here, in this new book, importantly, he is driven also by his own learning. i think of him as a reflective practitioner. a fellow traveler. this is a good book, not a great book. a 5 star rating, however, for cleat intent and effort. this is a ‚Äúbig tent‚Äù book full of breadcrumbs of learning and insight. a book that will be relevant and helpful for many. the best chapters go deep. a single topic unpacked like empathy. the chapters in part 2 are substantive in this way. on the whole, however, the book goes wide (too wide) in addressing a broad range of both personal and public (civic) concerns. the civic focus requires separate treatment. really, a separate book. also, at times, this book is both over-written and under-written. a reporter‚Äôs dilemma. hard to find the middle ground balancing theory and practice (stories). in brief, at a deeper level, i think the book lacks an idea architecture in many ways. there is no integrating framework offered. his ‚Äúilluminator‚Äù frame partially does this but it is not fleshed out and defined rigorously enough. the book is more akin to a reporter‚Äôs field learnings coupled with a graduate student‚Äôs enthusiasm. the book has a palpable sense of discovery about it and offers us the promise of learning and seeing in new ways. and, indeed, it does that. brooks helps us us take stock and see in new ways. learning these social skills and the ‚Äúseeing others‚Äù skills more fully, more attentively, that brooks points to, however, is not easy. i would have liked him to go deeper explaining how these skills are acquired and deepened. that said, i applaud brooks task and his field research and his own reflections. he is a good role model in both his personal and professional life in the quest for lived wisdom. see chapter 17, ‚Äúwhat is wisdom ?‚Äù. this is a well intended effort at pulling together this book and his learnings. finally, his dedication to his deceased friend peter marks, his best friend, speaks volumes. read chapter 10 and his poignant recollections of his friend. pitch perfect writing found here.",30-10-2023,059323006x,14,34,19.89,4.5,alice walstead,2022,"thriller, mystery, suspense",alice,walstead,3,30,10,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,1

the seven husbands of evelyn hugo: a novel,the seven husbands of evelyn hugo: mason's review,madison,4,"‚Äúpeople think that intimacy is about sex. but intimacy is about truth. when you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.‚Äùtaylor jenkins reid‚Äôs the seven husbands of evelyn hugo tells the authentic story of legendary hollywood actress evelyn hugo through an autobiographical medium, with ambitious ‚Äúvivant‚Äù journalist monique grant scribing her tale. throughout the interview, hugo reveals the behind-the-scenes secrets of her life acting in the film industry, detailing how she repressed her cuban heritage to conform to the hollywood scene, how she not only experienced but capitalized on the industry‚Äôs sexism and double standards, how she used her body and married famous men to get her to the top, how she found true friendship and forbidden love, and how she admits that she would do it all again if given a chance. as hugo engrosses grant and the readers with her story, the question of ‚Äòwhy would a famous hollywood actress want to speak with an up-and-coming journalist like monique grant, why her?‚Äô lingers in the back of our minds, and soon, we learn the real reason why hugo wanted grant to write her autobiography. as a student enrolled in an intermediate fiction writing course, i was particularly eager to review this novel after reading it for the first time last year. to say that i thoroughly enjoyed reading it is an understatement.taylor jenkins reid never fails to impress me with her craft in creating and developing characters, i find that to be a strong element of the novel that contributed to my appeal; evelyn hugo is one of the most compelling protagonists i have ever read about in my entire life, and i adored the fact that she was all morally shades of grey and not a good person when it came to her rise to the top of the hollywood ladder. she felt no regrets about the manipulations and schemes she created to get her to the singularity, which thrilled me, but seeing her vulnerable side away from the flashing cameras was also a real treat. harry cameron and celia st. james serve as strong secondary characters who held a major influence on hugo; one whom she shared a deep platonic connection with, and the other, to whom she was helplessly in love with and devoted. taylor jenkins reid wonderfully illustrates the ups and downs of the friendship between evelyn and harry, the struggles and clashes between evelyn and celia, and the tragedy evelyn experienced losing them both.another element that stood out to me was the setting of the novel. hugo‚Äôs interview reveals how she built and stepped away from her career as a renowned hollywood actress, often inspiring her to move across different locations to preserve her private image. to her detriment and benefit, the press follows hugo wherever she goes, with journalist companies like ‚Äúsub rosa,‚Äù ‚Äúphotomoment,‚Äù ‚Äúhollywood digest,‚Äù and the ‚Äúnew york tribune‚Äù writing articles about her fabricated life (while not realizing it), and spreading gossip. seeing those newspaper clippings pop up in the chapters gives the novel a sparkling touch, making the environment feel more authentic. it also is no surprise that taylor jenkins reid took inspiration from old hollywood icons such as marilyn monroe and elizabeth taylor to craft the character of evelyn hugo; she fits right into the time period where her story blossoms.finally, the last element that stood out to me above all else was evelyn‚Äôs plot arc. she goes from feeling determined to make it to the singularity and steal the audience's attention to wanting to give it all up for celia st. james, the love of her life, in a way that feels so natural and real. her wanting to build an image as a renowned actress came from wanting to get out of hell‚Äôs kitchen and prove to people, especially her abusive father, that she has the talent and worth to make it big. but, as she meets and falls for celia, she feels compelled to spend every moment with her, and she keeps up her work ethic but hides her feelings so the career she sacrificed so much of her authentic self for doesn‚Äôt die in vain. of course, that comes with hardships in her relationship with celia, but we see how her decision to leave all of the hollywood glory behind makes sense after the fact. it‚Äôs bittersweet.if you‚Äôre in the market for a juicy contemporary beach read or a compelling novel that handles serious topics elegantly, the seven husbands of evelyn hugo is worth a read and is the book for you.",27-04-2023,1501161938,8,39,9.49,4.6,morgan housel,2020,"finance, nonfiction, psychology, business, self help, money, economics",morgan,housel,8,27,4,2023,Spring,2,N√∂tr,Pozitif,3

the seven husbands of evelyn hugo: a novel,hollywood hasn't changed much,chelscey,5,"starting at the young age of fourteen and ending when she‚Äôs seventy-nine (when we first meet evelyn), evelyn hugo has gone from bombshell, to sexpot, to oscar winner, to civil rights supporter. evelyn knew what she wanted from an early age‚Äîto get out of hell‚Äôs kitchen and away from her abusive father, and to be the biggest star anyone has ever heard of. and she accomplished that! partially because of her talent, partially because she knows her worth and is unafraid to get dirty in order to achieve her goals, and partially because there is no one better at using the press and scandals to serve their own interests. evelyn is both a force to be reckoned with, but also a deeply flawed and lonely. shown through the perspective of evelyn as she dictates her memoir to monique, the reader is taken back to the early days of hollywood to watch evelyn‚Äôs rise, and her stumbles, to and through stardom. for a story about a hollywood starlet, this book is layered, and i don‚Äôt think i was expecting the level of depth it had, even though many reviews warned me to expect the unexpected with this story.in order to become evelyn hugo, hollywood‚Äôs biggest star, evelyn had to let go of who she was; erasing her identity to be what hollywood wanted her to be. she knew and accepted this, always, but it does break your heart a little to watch her identity get stripped away so that she could be the blonde bombshell the screen so loved. the things evelyn hid or changed, often denying the realest parts of herself in the process, really hit me in the feels, and there were parts at the end of the book that had me welling up with tears if that tells you anything. i won‚Äôt say more because the way the story unfolds is really lovely with getting to know all 7 of evelyn‚Äôs husbands and the roles they played in her life, but i will say that i loved the inclusion of the fake articles to show the juxtaposition between what was evelyn‚Äôs reality versus what the public got to see, and how the press portrayed her in return.honestly, there was very little i did not like about this book, or its story. it flowed beautifully and, while not necessarily one of those books you couldn‚Äôt put down (i had no issues stopping in reading for the night) it was never dull. it had a smooth, and highly enjoyable writing style. however, my only issues were that sometimes, with the book being told in 1st person, monique didn‚Äôt always feel that distinct to me from evelyn. which may be mostly because we don‚Äôt really get to know monique at the same level at which we get to know evelyn, though i did enjoy their relationship and how they were able to help each other, even when that got . . . tricky, to say the least. but i also didn‚Äôt like celia for a majority of the book, either. i found her to be so frustrating at times, that i often wondered why evelyn even bothered having her around. thankfully that changed toward the end, but still.but, all in all, i loved this book and this story. it was so empowering, watching evelyn be so unashamed to own her beauty, her sex appeal, her confidence, and to be the ball-buster she was, so unafraid of telling people what she wants, what she deserves‚Äîall because she knows her worth. i didn‚Äôt know how much i needed a story, to see a woman like that, until i read this book. but i also loved that the author didn‚Äôt shy away from evelyn‚Äôs flaws, or the fact that, for a lot of evelyn‚Äôs life, she was deeply lonely. evelyn wasn‚Äôt perfect, but she didn‚Äôt let that be an excuse for anyone to treat her poorly. i will say there are some instances of spousal abuse in this book though, so just be forewarned if that kind of trauma is sensitive for you. i thought the author handled those topics amazingly well, but i‚Äôve also never experienced such things for myself, either. because this book brought tears to my eyes with that whole last third of the story, it easily gets 5 stars from me! this is such a satisfying, and empowering book!",25-04-2022,1501161938,4,39,9.49,4.6,morgan housel,2020,"finance, nonfiction, psychology, business, self help, money, economics",morgan,housel,8,25,4,2022,Spring,2,N√∂tr,Pozitif,2

hundred years' war on palestine,"a good, comprehensive summary",a h kobayashi,3,"this short book is rather ambitious in the sense that it sums up the history of the conflicts in israel/palestine in just over 250 pages. so inevitably, khalidi left out certain details. his assessment of the history of the conflict is in a way predictable, as he portrays zionism as nothing but a colonial movement and he blames britain and then the us for propping up israel as if it had been a victim of persecution by the arabs. there are some puzzling omissions, as he does not talk much about the real motives of the arab nations in the wake of the collapse of the ottoman empire. the hashemite kingdom‚Äôs role in early jewish immigration cannot be ignored in this history, but he does not touch this thorny issue. the big surprise is the almost total omission of the yom kippur war. although khalidi did experience israeli violence in lebanon personally, he doesn‚Äôt sound like someone in close touch with the people actually there, especially in gaza. that is indeed the problem of the plo or the fatah, by his own admission, that they were out of touch. as i always got an impression that they were playing a cynical power game, by deliberating placing the palestinians in harms way so that they could counter the israeli narrative of national victimhood. but khalidi, though admitting this problem, does not explore the politics of the plo leadership deeply enough. hamas needs to be examined more in detail, but perhaps he is not so well informed? at least, this book serves as a good summary of the conflict from a palestinian perspective, though personally, i would like to hear the voices of those who actually live in gaza or the west bank. undoubtedly, the best part of the book is the final chapter, in which he explains how us policy worked and how the palestinians have consistently failed to influence the us (i.e., they were always outwitted and outsmarted by the israelis). he almost sounds more like a liberal american than a palestinian. his proposed course of action for the palestinian leaders are sound, but also too academic, which would be difficult to implement, unfortunately.",27-05-2021,1250787653,4,42,12.99,4.6,rashid khalidi,2019,"history, nonfiction, politics, war",rashid,khalidi,4,27,5,2021,Spring,2,Pozitif,Negatif,2

elon musk,"if you want to grow an elon musk personality, skip standard life advice",ethan,5,"one of the conclusions i reached early in my life is that there is a huge disconnect between so called ""conventional wisdom"" in most important areas of life and what actually works in real life as shown for example in the difference between being an a-list celebrity and ranking high in the forbes' list of wealthiest individuals.elon musk's life, that walter isaacson documents in this book, is a prime example of this disconnect.if you go by standard advice about what it takes to get admitted into one of america's top schools, there is no way that in 2023 a white kid without connections who grew up in a somehow privileged background -upper middle class in segregated south africa- who scores 1400 (v670, q730) in the sat in his second try would be offered admission at any of america's top universities. and yet, this what elon musk looked like on paper circa 1992 when he applied as transfer student to the university of pennsylvania. luckily for the united states, admission committees at america's top schools 30 years ago were more rational than their contemporary counterparts. elon musk gained admission to the university of pennsylvania and the rest, as they say, is history.my path crossed with elon musk's at the stanford seminar mentioned at the beginning of chapter 20 of the book. back then i was a nervous young professional who had just submitted his application for graduate study at stanford praying that i would get in. i recall two things distinctively from that talk: 1) elon's telling that he had dropped out of stanford to start his first company -i told myself that i would not be as silly if i got in-, 2) that he told the audience during the qa that he didn't think a particular degree or life experience prepared someone better than others to become a successful entrepreneur. both ideas went against the standard advice i had heard from other speakers at the entrepreneurial thought leaders seminar and, unimpressed, i didn't go to say hello to elon musk at the end of the talk. in the book i learn that it's in that seminar that jeffrey straubel approached elon for an investment in tesla.i have gone back many times in my mind to that october 2003 talk since elon musk began to be recognized for his genius in silicon valley circles (late 2000s, early 2010s).it is often said that a person's character is forged during a person's childhood and teen years. the biggest insight i am getting from walter isaacson's book is that elon musk's were the exact opposite of what experts in child and teen development say what those years should be like.i get that elon musk is a controversial personality with some. at the same time, the western civilization needs more people like him if it wants to continue to be the leading civilization in the world both on the technological front as well as on the population front -his ideas on low birthrates being the biggest threat to civilization are right on the money.to summarize, i cannot recommend this book highly enough.i want thank both elon musk as well as walter isaacson for partnering to make it a reality. it's very rare in human history to have a chance to get such a detailed insight into the mind of one of the contemporary history making personalities.",09-10-2023,1982181281,13,61,20.99,4.7,walter isaacson,2023,"biography, nonfiction, business, technology",walter,isaacson,4,9,10,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,0
elon musk,rocket man,david shulman,5,"every aerospace executive and board member should read walter isaacson‚Äôs biography of elon musk. starting from scratch musk has built america‚Äôs leading rocket and space communications company by ignoring the hidebound bureaucratic rules of the major aerospace companies delivering rockets at one tenth the cost of his bloated competitors. musk‚Äôs rules are:1. doubt every requirement.2. question every cost?3. act with a sense of urgency.4. learn by failing.5. improvise.the other secret that musk applied to tesla as well as spacex is that he integrated design, engineering, and manufacturing so that each of those entities can learn from the others. thus, engineers and designers are able to make improvements in manufacturing as issues arise. steve jobs at apple integrated design and engineering, but outsourced manufacturing to china.rising from an unhappy childhood in south africa, musk became a silicon valley entrepreneur to become part of the famed ‚Äúpaypal mafia.‚Äù he used his paypal success to fund tesla and spacex and the rest is history.musk‚Äôs genius has the ability to inspire loyalty, at least for a time, of a host brilliant people who built his empire. however, empathy is not his middle name, and, in many ways, he seems to be a very cruel person. he is one of those people who professes to love humanity, but really doesn‚Äôt like people as individuals.isaacson discusses musk‚Äôs chaotic personal life. three marriages, 11 children two of whom by sperm donation. isaacson doesn‚Äôt explain why so many of musk‚Äôs children were conceived by in vitro fertilization.then, of course there is twitter, now called x after his favorite letter. his adventure at twitter seems to be one giant ego trip where he promised to free that social media site from it ‚Äúwokeness.‚Äù to say the staff of twitter was woke, would be an understatement. he wanted to encourage free expression, yet under his rule twitter has become a cesspool of hate.i had my own run in with twitter. despite all of musk‚Äôs talk of a new openness i was banned for using the term ‚Äúcircular firing squad‚Äù to characterize hunter biden bringing his father into his legal thicket. something is really wrong with x and from press accounts is seems to be getting worse by the day.despite being hagiographic at times, isaacson brings to life one of our leading entrepreneurs who is bringing us into new electric and space ages.",14-10-2023,1982181281,2,61,20.99,4.7,walter isaacson,2023,"biography, nonfiction, business, technology",walter,isaacson,4,14,10,2023,Autumn,4,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0
elon musk,isaacson's best - a tour de force on three dimensions,nilendu misra,5,"this book is very likely isaacson's best. one, he got almost unlimited access to elon and team for two years. two, elon! three, a fascinating case of embracing risk-with-capital-r as not something to avoid (""do no harm""), not something to optimize (risk-reward analysis) but something to warmly embrace and overcome with will, ""surge"" and first-principle driven engineering.the book has essentially three broad parallel themes often intertwined in narratives -relationship -- family and friends - relationship and evolution of it with elon's parents, grandparents of both sides, kids, spouses/sos, siblings - especially kimbal, cousins and a handful of business friends including some employees in both tesla and spacex.results -- zip2/paypal, evs, solarroof, rockets/nasa, neuralink, hyperloop, twitter - workspaces where elon ventured and revolutionized them.regulating principles - this is where isaacson has done a masterful job. he observed, probed and eked out a set of rules that elon follows - with himself, with how he gets work done, with other people.as someone who's worked (""hardcore""ly, if i may) in tesla during famed ""production hell"" and was lucky to witness several of the events mentioned - e.g., 5000th car of the week, a black model 3, coming out of factory on june 30, 2018 at 2 am-ish - isaacson's description of tesla, and its mission-driven culture, is accurate, though as a genuine believer in that mission, seemed awfully short. some of elon's brilliant ""management emails"" deserved a mention - e.g., how not/to communicate (no abbreviations; hierarchy agnostic), how to/not meet (get out if you are adding no value), how to set goals (hofstadder's law - set it so ambitious that even missing it by 50% would still get it done twice as fast had it not been set so) etc. plus, elon is always highly readable, and short.to bridge to standard practices of management, as it is followed in most western world today, the author follows up with most people after they had ""interesting pushbacks"" from elon, mostly when they either did not have an answer and did not say they did not know, or when - simply - elon was thinking far ahead of them, and thinking multi-threaded to not offer much of ""contextual relevance"". the emphasis on ""small teams with right individuals will always outcompete large teams"" is spot on and is essentially why autopilot is successful with 150 engineers and twitter was awfully slow moving with few thousands.last third of the book was often observed and written in first person. the author was present in many of those events. but that takes a little bit away from the velocity of the book and perhaps adds 50-60 more pages that merely repeat the themes already established, with apt narratives, earlier in the book. moving twitter's 5000 servers from sacramento data center to portland - first thought to take months till elon diverted his jet, landed in sacramento, opened an air vent with a (borrowed) utility knife, went underneath the rack and essentially did a ""poc"" - is one such example. it was an intersting read, especially for an engineer, irrespective.no single individual in last 100 years, perhaps, did change things more for ""humanity as a macro"". ""elon musk"" is the best way to understand him and is a brilliant, captivating read. the grand theme of the book, to me, was as elon was quoted - ""this is how civilizations decline. they quit taking risks. and when they quit taking risks, their arteries harden. every year there are more referees and fewer doers.""this is not just a book on elon musk. this is a book to look at risk with a fundamentally different world-, or should i say 'cosmic-', view.",15-09-2023,1982181281,10,61,20.99,4.7,walter isaacson,2023,"biography, nonfiction, business, technology",walter,isaacson,4,15,9,2023,Autumn,3,Pozitif,Pozitif,0
elon musk,an expedition into the genius of elon musk: a review of walter isaacson‚Äôs portrayal,*at,5,"walter isaacson‚Äôs narrative on elon musk is nothing short of a masterful voyage through the labyrinth of one of the most iconic innovators of our age. the book is a meticulously crafted narrative, weaving the intricacies of musk‚Äôs remarkable journey with a depth that leaves the reader both inspired and enlightened. it‚Äôs a comprehensive expedition into the life and mind of elon musk (em), displaying an exquisite balance of awe-inspiring moments coupled with a grounded critique that keeps the narrative tethered to a realm of practicality.the section that notably stands out is the exploration into em‚Äôs management mantras. the unraveling of 'the algorithm,' a term synonymous with musk‚Äôs methodical approach towards problem-solving, and the traits he values in his team - excellence, trust, and discipline, are not merely discussed but dissected. this portion of the book is a well of insights for anyone eager to decode the enigmatic leadership style of em.isaacson, with his seasoned narrative prowess, doesn‚Äôt merely tell a story; he takes you on an intellectual expedition, unveiling layers of em‚Äôs persona and managerial acumen. the critique embedded within the narrative ensures the reader doesn‚Äôt get lost in the glorification but stays grounded, appreciating the practical implications and the tangible takeaways from musk‚Äôs journey.a unique charm of isaacson‚Äôs writing is his ability to delve deep into the subject while maintaining a broader perspective. the wish for his next venture to contrast the geniuses he‚Äôs chronicled is palpable. one can only anticipate the richness such a narrative would entail, juxtaposing the different shades of brilliance that have shaped the modern technological epoch.in conclusion, this book isn‚Äôt just a biography; it‚Äôs a meticulously crafted lens through which one can appreciate the genius of elon musk, rendered with a level of finesse and understanding that is quintessentially isaacson. it‚Äôs not just a read, but an experience, that leaves you with a profound understanding and a lingering curiosity for the boundless realm of innovation.",14-10-2023,1982181281,14,61,20.99,4.7,walter isaacson,2023,"biography, nonfiction, business, technology",walter,isaacson,4,14,10,2023,Autumn,4,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0
elon musk,a great man of history,mark r. whittington,5,"this is a fascinating biography that tells the warts and all story of one of the greatest men of the 21st century. elon musk has emerged from a toxic and abusive childhood to becoming the richest man on the planet, having revolutionized space travel and reinvented the electric car. the book tells in detail about how he did those things, as well as delving into robotics, ai, neural implants to cure blindness and paralysis, and other things.the book also notes that musk is far from a nice guy, lacking the ability to feel empathy and having a tendency to fly into rages as well as deep depression. the book does not exactly put its subject on the couch, but it does give an insight into what drives him.musk personifies the great man theory of history. the theory suggests that history is driven by great men (almost always men) who rise to power seemingly out of nowhere and drive people and nations to achieve great things. just imagine what our world would be like without musk and one must conclude that, for all of his quirks and flaws, the world is lucky to have him in it.",15-10-2023,1982181281,5,61,20.99,4.7,walter isaacson,2023,"biography, nonfiction, business, technology",walter,isaacson,4,15,10,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,0

tom lake: a reese's book club pick,a buddhist blend of grovers corners and northern michigan,switterbug/betsey van horn,5,"appreciating the little things in life, the joy of day-to-day existence, and the love for your family and your work is what tom lake meant to me. tom lake refers to a (fictional) summer stock theater in northern michigan in the 1980s, close to the locale of the current 2020 timeline--- a cherry farm (and pears, and apples). the late eighties marked a luminous period for protagonist/narrator lara, a time that she walked the fine line between adulting and adulthood, coming of age amid a torrent of drama that swept her up in its fury. and then there was our town, the play within the novel that portrayed lara‚Äôs life on the stage (and backstage).lara is telling her three twenty-something daughters about her short stint as an actress in her twenties, and the brief romantic affair with peter duke, a famous movie star before he was a famous movie star. the gorgeous cherry farm backdrop is like a staid but vivid character, with lara, husband joe, and the three girls all together for the first time in a while. due to the pandemic, they don‚Äôt have the usual crew to help pick the fruit, so the storytelling unfolds as the family works the orchard during harvest time. like the cherries, some parts are sweet, some tart, and all of it is juicy.i felt the air, inhaled the scents, the cherries, the land and the whole layout of the farm while reading. and there is the kindness, too, of this family, whose flaws are also part of their strengths. the chaos of lara‚Äôs life as a young woman is juxtaposed with the serenity of her life now, and the two timelines fluidly alternate, sometimes gently, at other times with piercing intensity. and every storyline has at least two. so, when you read about lara in the past, or present, you just can‚Äôt help sniffing around to see the connections, of what surprise is crouched in the corner or hidden behind the door. i verily slipped into lara‚Äôs character and imagined what decisions i would make as her, given so many pressing options and dilemmas.ann patchett nails it every time, her characters are complex and her graceful pace is measured even when events are brutal. lara is a radiant work-in-progress during her young years, many readers will see themselves in her. i was a local stage actor in austin during my twenties, so i immersed myself in tom lake, pretending to be lara acting as emily gibbs and then back to lara again. the two timelines showed the difference between the fiery summer love of youth and the deep, tender, and mature love of family that you helped to create. the high points were explosive, even when they were pin-drop quiet. lara‚Äôs low points stirred me almost to tears; i could feel her pulse against mine.if you‚Äôve never seen a production or haven‚Äôt read our town, you‚Äôre about to get a spoiler‚Äôs worth in the novel. but i think ms. patchett has surmised that most of her readers are already familiar with thornton wilder‚Äôs play. she coalesced our town and tom lake together in a way that reveals her refined skill of integration. tom lake and our town were separate but conjoined. i know that doesn‚Äôt make sense, but it will when you read the book. she also quotes chekhov at pique (and even peak) intervals; she shares the russian writer‚Äôs work with spare but specific devotion.i recently learned that patchett has never owned a smart phone, and doesn‚Äôt herself do social media (she talks to the camera and her staff completes the rest). she has never used google, or researched on wiki‚Äîshe does it the old-fashioned way. and perhaps she‚Äôs that slightly eccentric but lovely gentlewoman you see carrying paper road maps!tom lake is thoughtful, deft, and life-affirming. (it isn‚Äôt a pandemic novel, even though it takes place during that time). there‚Äôs comedy, tragedy, drama‚Äîa look-back-at-your- own-life kind of book. it‚Äôs classic ann patchett.there‚Äôs this passage that really tickled me from the book. it‚Äôs toward the end but not a spoiler, it‚Äôs thematic with the rest of the narrative. lara was so busy recounting the past for her daughters that she forgot to make lunch, which she said she should have been working on while talking. ‚Äúthe past need not be so all-encompassing that it renders us incapable of making egg salad.‚Äù priorities!",10-08-2023,006332752x,9,64,15.33,4.3,ann patchett,2023,"literary, medical, family life - general, world literature - india - general",ann,patchett,12,10,8,2023,Summer,3,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0

tom lake: a reese's book club pick,a book to savor and reflect on,bonnie brody,5,"ann patchett is one of my favorite writers and she has once again written a novel i love.the novel takes place at the beginning of the covid epidemic. lara, her husband, and her three young adult daughters are residing on the family orchard in northern michigan. the narrative is told from lara's viewpoint and consists primarily of her daughters' wanting to know about her past life - especially her romantic involvement with the now famous actor, peter duke.much of the story is about a summer stock stage production of 'our town' located in michigan on tom lake. lara is in her twenties and has been called upon to take the lead role after the original actress has decided to quit. on lara's first day, she is greeted by a charismatic young man named peter duke. from their first meeting evolves a drawn-out romance and affair that leaves lara much beholden to peter's narcissistic view of himself. lara is quite aware that her daughters want to know all the intimacies that she and peter shared, but she is not ready to give out these details freely.it is understood that lara once had a promising future in acting but she chose to give it up for what she considers her idyllic life as a mother and wife. her daughters find this all hard to absorb and want to know every last bit about laura's time with peter and her involvement with the stage.the writing flows beautifully and the imagery is incandescent. i could see lara and feel her emotions. ann patchett knows people and her empathic writing exudes from every page. there isn't one false note.i have never read our town but that didn't stop me from loving this novel, nor did it prevent me from understanding what was transpiring. i learned a lot about stage production, acting, and actors.i especially loved how the author provided each of her daughters with a distinct and inimitable personality, all beloved to her and each other. this is a book to savor and reflect on. it is as sweet as the smell of cherries in lara's michigan orchard.",10-09-2023,006332752x,7,64,15.33,4.3,ann patchett,2023,"literary, medical, family life - general, world literature - india - general",ann,patchett,12,10,9,2023,Autumn,3,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0

tom lake: a reese's book club pick,a fabulous story from one of america's great novelists,bway jack,5,"i love ann patchett, whose gifts as a storyteller are almost unmatched, as wide-ranging as her varying choice of subjects. tom lake is another triumph- and not just because it centers around folks in the theatre. although i'm sure that helped.lara kenison played emily webb in her high school production of our town, as have so many young girls have in their past. but for lara, it becomes a touchstone in her life. in college, she reprises the role, and a famous hollywood agent happens to see her performance. the tinseltown legend suddenly becomes real - flying to la, screen tests, her first film role, commercials, even a tv series. then, while waiting for the film's long-delayed release, she goes off to summer stock at tom lake in wisconsin. there, she meets her first great love, a fire of ambition named peter duke.years later, lara unspools the story of her hollywood adventure to her now-grown daughters, including some discrete details of her love affair with duke, now a huge movie star. lara and her husband joe run a fruit farm in rural michigan. the story of how she goes from the la dream factory to the cherry orchard unfolds while she and her daughters pick the ripening fruit in the hot summer sun.there are twists and turns in every story, and lara's journey from ingenue to farm wife has some hairpin turns that the reader will likely never see coming. it's patchett's great skill as a story master that keeps us as engaged as her daughters, hearing the tale unspool. while the three sisters (yes, in a cherry orchard) demand to know more, we are as eager as they to learn lara's tale of adventures on stage and off.i tore through this book in a few days, despite a busy end-of-summer schedule.

haunting adeline (cat and mouse duet),"help, i've fallen in love with a stalker",readwithevelane,5,"there's a reason i don't read incomplete duets or series because then i'm sad when i can't read the next book. i went against my better judgment with this book and i have no regrets (okay i have some because i hated waiting for book two) because i loved this story. the great news is the second book is out now, so you don't have to wait if you're reading this review!i've never read anything remotely similar to this book and i don't know that i ever will. this was my first time reading something truly as dark as this. i've read other books with heavy triggers, but this book was different. i read satan's affair beforehand (highly recommend reading that first) and i wasn't entirely sure what this book was going to be about. i knew a past murder, stalking, and love were involved, but that was it. if you had told me one of my top reads from 2021 would've been a stalker romance, i would've laughed in your face. not only is the romance good, and the spice is off the charts hot, but the overarching story is just so good.adeline is an author who moves into her grandmother's old home after she passes away. adeline was close to her grandmother and felt a pull to come back to the home that always fascinated her. while living in the house, she discovers family secrets that have been buried for a long time, secrets involving her great grandmother. her great grandmother was stalked, but here's the kicker? her great grandmother had a spicy affair with her stalker! adeline's great grandmother was murdered and she works with her best friend to figure out who did it. while trying to solve this mystery, adeline finds herself in the same place as her great grandmother did with a hot stalker.zade is a leader of a vigilante group that's only mission is to bring down trafficking rings and the horrible people that run them. and not just any type of trafficking rings. rings that are linked to very powerful people in the country and the world. zade is determined to get as many women and children to safety as he can. he puts himself in the line of fire to save the lives of the innocent people taken by these rings. he sounds like an ideal guy right? well, did i mention he's also adeline's stalker? zade stumbles across adeline by accident and it's a wrap for him. he wants to make her his and there's nothing that's going to stop him. now i'm not saying he's still not an ideal guy (i do love him), but let's just say these are two very opposite qualities. on one hand, you have this man trying to save women and child, but on the other hand he's stalking a woman. many would argue he can't be both a good and terrible guy at the same time, but i think this book begs to differ.i personally loved adeline and thought she was a dynamic heroine. she was sassy, fun, and radiated fierceness. she does stand up for herself throughout the book, even to zade, although standing up to him doesn't do much. i liked that we get her inner thoughts on zade as their relationship plays out. i like watching her slowly open up to him and trust that he'll protect her, which seems like the opposite thing a stalker would do. one of my favorite things was when adeline told her friend about one of her spicy encounters with zade and that he ""took her soul"". i couldn't be more jealous of her, trust me. based on the cliffhanger, book two isn't going to be an easy ride for adeline, but i know she's going to be okay. someone as fierce as her work her way through any situation, even if it takes some time.i cannot explain how much i love zade. i know, i know, he's a stalker. here's the thing: i just don't care. he really had me contemplating if getting stalked is that bad (it is, but let's ignore that). i loved how he was written to be so multilayered. h.d. carlton knew what she was doing when she wrote him this way. he's meant to challenge everything you know and make you wonder if he's really all that bad. his qualities are so opposite of each other that he left me spinning so much throughout this book. i would take pauses while reading and say out loud, ""am i actually into this man?"" or ""i'm in love with this unhinged man. am i good?"" i laughed way too many times when doing this because i just know how people would react in my life if i told them how much i love zade. the mouth on zade is unmatched. god, that man says the wildest stuff, but it's so unbelievably hot. and the things he does with his hands to adeline? where do i sign up??? i love his love for adeline and i can't wait to see what he does in book two knowing how this book ended.the writing in this book is beautiful and so good. h.d. carlton is talented and it shows in this book. i enjoyed the different storylines taking place and how they all connected to one another. i thought it was interesting to see adeline live a similar life to her great grandmother. i think getting to read her great grandmother's thoughts on her own personal stalked helped adeline in her own way. this book is just so so so good! i cannot recommend it enough. i do strongly encourage everyone consider the triggers before reading. i look forward to book two!",08-02-2022,b09cggv8dx,8,70,13.36,4.4,h.d. carlton,2021,"dark, thriller, fantasy, adult, contemporary, mystery, horror",h.d.,carlton,7,8,2,2022,Winter,1,Pozitif,Pozitif,1

haunting adeline (cat and mouse duet),this book remade my moral compass,nat,5,"just a warning: do not pick up this book expecting something kind or sweet to happen, it won‚Äôt. please check the trigger warnings.premise- adeline reilly is a 26 year old indie author who has just moved into her late grandmother‚Äôs gothic and creepy manor- she absolutely loves this.her life is turned upside down when she caught the attention of a powerful and known vigilante, who takes down trafficking rings and saves women and children for a living. zade meadows is not one to be messed with.. especially if it involves his new found obsession- adeline. and when i say obsession, i mean stalking. i don‚Äôt consider it a romance novel, but yes indeed, this is a dark romance. emphasize on dark because nothing about this book is normally cute. i‚Äôll explain myself.the story- haunting adeline is a book that dives deep down into the evil side of humanity, actually- it dives into the side where there is none. despite its ‚Äúdark romance‚Äù label, i have to unfortunately label it, reality. while there is romance in the book, it is not your peaches and cream type romance. more like blood and insanity. we follow along to see adeline be stalked by zade since the moment he laid eyes on her, he does everything in his power to make her his, even when she says no.the world building- is insanely accurate to real life, it is real life. h.d. carlton did a fantastic job at capturing the essence of what goes on in this messed up world. the accuracy scared me more than the story did, and that‚Äôs a great thing to me!the trigger warnings- please read them, if you‚Äôre not someone like me who now looks at these lists like a shopping list, then please read the warnings.my thoughts- listen.. there are zero words i can gather to express how this book made me feel, other than i. love. it. i couldn‚Äôt even tell you why. maybe it has something to do with the characters? it could be the level of intensity zade‚Äôs obsession with adeline is at? maybe it‚Äôs that he‚Äôs quite literally a walking ironic, vigilante? or is it that this book and the relationship to me screams ‚Äúdeadly love‚Äù? at this point, i‚Äôm convinced i‚Äôm just as deranged as adeline because while haunting is dark- and hunting adeline is darker.. it had me giggling and kicking my feet like an excited 4 year old, the chokehold zade has on me is probably unhealthy, but i‚Äôm in the accepting stage so, let‚Äôs roll with it.conclusion- i‚Äôm not going to sit here and lie or pretend.. by the end of this review, you may believe i‚Äôm deranged, maybe even crazy. this story had me burning through the pages, i finished it in 12 hours to then pick up hunting and finish that in under 5. i could not put it down. yes, i read the trigger warnings. yes, this is the first book i jumped into dark romance with. no, i don‚Äôt regret it at all.. especially now because dark romance is my weakness. if this is the worst out there, and i just strolled through it like i was in a park, then i say bring it on to others.you will either hate this book with all your being, or absolutely love it so much, it hurts.. like me. there is no in between.",01-09-2023,b09cggv8dx,6,70,13.36,4.4,h.d. carlton,2021,"dark, thriller, fantasy, adult, contemporary, mystery, horror",h.d.,carlton,7,1,9,2023,Autumn,3,N√∂tr,Pozitif,2

verity,"dark, twisted, & shocking -- lives up to the hype!",jhsiess,4,"verity opens with author lowen ashleigh having a very bad morning. her mother died the previous week after a year-long battle with colon cancer. lowen had a difficult relationship with her mother -- ""a direct result of my own mother being terrified of me,"" she relates -- but still brought her to lowen's apartment and cared for her during the last nine months of her life. lowen is a sleepwalker and her mother kept her fairly secluded as a child, afraid of what lowen might be capable of doing during one of many sleepwalking episodes. now she has left her apartment in new york city for the first time in weeks, summoned to a meeting at her publisher's office by her literary agent, corey, with whom she was previously in an intimate relationship. just as lowen is waiting for a crosswalk light to change, a man steps into the street and is struck by a truck. lowen is understandably shaken, and the man's blood is splattered on her face and white shirt.a handsome stranger escorts her into a coffee shop bathroom and literally gives her the shirt off his back. they chat briefly, and loewn concludes that he ""wants to be invisible in this city. just like me."" after all, she moved to new york to become part of the city's invisible millions of invisible residents. her books have not sold well enough for her publisher to offer her another contract unless she agrees to promote them, something she has refused to do in the past. ""i'm so awkward i'm afraid once my readers meet me in person, they'll swear off my books forever,"" lowen laments. ""that's why i stay home and write. i think the idea of me is better than the reality of me."" but another contract was her last hope. she took time off from her writing career believing that her mother would leave her some money. now, having lived off the advance she received after signing her prior contract, she has learned that she will receive nothing from her mother's estate. and be homeless soon, unless she receives a job offer.when lowen arrives at her publisher's office, she is shocked to find the man whose shirt she is wearing is attending the same meeting. he is jeremy crawford, husband of verity, a very successful author who is unable to complete the series of books she was writing. lowen is being offered a flat fee of seventy-five thousand dollars per book to write the last three volumes in the series, with the first installment due in six months. lowen is determined to turn down the offer until jeremy informs her that he selected her because verity read one of lowen's books and it was among her favorites. she purportedly told jeremy that they shared a similar writing style and lowen was destined to be ""the next big thing."" verity has been catastrophically injured in a motor vehicle accident, following the deaths of both of her daughters, chastin and harper, leaving jeremy to raise their young son, crew, alone. lowen ultimately agrees to take on the project.lowen makes the six-hour drive to the crawford home in vermont, listening to the audio version of the first book in the series en route. she is to spend time in verity's office, reviewing the research and notes she left there in order to assess how best to approach writing the next book. lowen meets crew and learns that verity's condition is extremely serious. she is in a virtually catatonic state -- uncommunicative and unable to care for herself. caregivers spend the day in the home, with jeremy managing at night. lowen soon discovers that verity's office lacks organization -- her expansive desk is strewn with stacks from end to end with papers and files, and boxes containing more documents line the walls. clearly, the process of sorting through it all will take much longer than lowen originally anticipated. as she begins reading verity's second book, she realizes the ""books are from the villain's point of view"" and she will need ""time to work myself into that mindset while writing."" jeremy claims that he has never read verity's books because he ""didn't like being inside her head.""author colleen hoover recounts lowen's story via a first-person narrative, with the story really taking off as lowen attempts to settles into the crawford home. she is keenly observant and inquisitive about verity's writing, as well as her family, and quickly finds herself attracted to jeremy, who is still married to the incapacitated woman being cared for in an upstairs bedroom. searching through verity's office, lowen stumbles upon a manuscript entitled ""so be it."" verity hopes it is an outline for the next book, but it is instead an autobiography drafted by verity. reading it is not what she has been hired to do, but she justifies her insatiable curiosity by construing her review of the manuscript as research. ""i need to see how verity's mind works to understand her as a writer."" soon she is absorbed in verity's descriptions of meeting jeremy, the development of their relationship and the early days of their marriage, as well as her pregnancies and motherhood. the more she reads, the more frightened of verity lowen becomes, especially when events she observes appear to be inconsistent with what she has been told about verity's condition. nonetheless, lowen continues returning to the manuscript to better understand the crawford family's history, and gain insight into jeremy and verity's marriage. but lowen is playing a dangerous game. verity's purported autobiography is a dark and disturbing confession of verity's feelings, motivations, and unspeakably vile acts. lowen believes the manuscript to be an accurate depiction of verity's life, and concludes that it ""was written by a very disturbed woman -- a woman whose house i currently inhabit.""hoover ramps up the tension as lowen becomes entangled in a budding relationship with jeremy, influenced heavily by what she is reading in the manuscript. verity's revelations are horrifying, and as lowen and jeremy grow closer, he increasingly opens up to her, sharing details of his life with verity about which lowen feigns ignorance. lowen's suspicions about the accident in which verity was injured grow. is jeremy being completely honest with lowen? why is he willing to embark on a new relationship with lowen when his wife, although injured, is still alive? he claims that he cannot move verity to a care facility because crew cannot sustain another loss. while verity is cared for in their home, crew can spend unlimited amounts of time at her bedside. lowen now possesses detailed information about the deaths of jeremy's daughters. were their deaths really tragic accidents? is crew safe?hoover's characters are both fascinating and infuriating. the story is related solely from lowen's perspective. her childhood was difficult because of her sleepwalking and the way it detrimentally impacted her relationship with her mother. she has achieved modest success as a writer, but because of her discomfort in social situations, her career growth has been stymied. she accepts the offer to write verity's next three books because she desperately needs the money, but also because it is an opportunity too good to pass up. but she is confused not only by her burgeoning attraction to jeremy, but the incongruity between what she has been told about verity's accident and what transpires in the house. of course, lowen's feelings and experiences are colored by the information set forth in the manuscript. interestingly, hoover has said that even when she depicts lowen reading verity's manuscript, readers are ""still not fully in verity‚Äôs head because we‚Äôre always in lowen‚Äôs perspective, reading something she found. when i write a book from one character‚Äôs point of view, i rarely think about the story from the other character‚Äôs perspectives. sometimes it‚Äôs necessary for certain scenes, but with this book, it was important for me to feel the confusion and fear lowen felt. so as the author, i had to be completely blind to what was happening from everyone else's perspectives."" still, as the story progresses, hoover keeps readers guessing as to how gullible and vulnerable lowen really is. she believes the manuscript is truthful and accurate, and that jeremy is not the villain -- if, in fact there is a villain in the crawfords' story. but could lowen possibly be opportunistic, calculating, and willing to do anything to be with jeremy?jeremy is equally captivating. he is handsome, charming, successful, and by all outward appearances, a family man who has sustained unimaginable losses who has been able to soldier on only because he has a young son to raise. to be fair, although verity's prognosis is never affirmatively established, his desire to move on with his life is understandable -- verity sustained a serious head injury which will, in all likelihood, preclude her from resuming a fully normal life. but was his meeting with lowen on the street just before the meeting at her publisher's office really just coincidental? did he intend for her to find the manuscript in verity's office? has he been fully aware of its contents all along? about that, hoover says, ""i‚Äôm not sure because i was never in jeremy‚Äôs head."" in other words, readers can draw their own conclusions, based on the evidence hoover does present.and what about verity? is she selfishly conniving and evil, as the manuscript suggests? or is she a blameless grieving mother who was tragically injured in a horrific car accident?the manuscript provides myriad complications. lowen debates whether she should discuss it with jeremy. she doesn't believe he is aware of its existence or content. he claimed he never read verity's books, after all. lowen learns that verity was injured when her vehicle hit a tree, but there were no skidmarks on the pavement. she concludes verity ""either fell asleep or she did it on purpose."" does it matter to lowen which scenario is accurate? what conclusion has jeremy drawn about the cause of the accident?putting aside the perspective from which the story is told, no aspect of the story or the characters can be accepted at face value. hoover includes plot twists so shocking and unnerving that verity, originally published in 2018, continues to be one of the most-discussed psychological thrillers ever written. (there is even a facebook discussion group devoted to the book, boasting nearly twenty-five thousand members!) the book is fast-paced, engrossing, and extremely entertaining. the story's pace gradually accelerates with each surprising development and breath-taking revelations of the truth or, perhaps, a manipulated version of the truth. the tale careens to a jaw-dropping conclusion that will keep readers thinking, discussing, and debating hoover's extremely clever and nuanced tale, as well as her deliciously intriguing and morally ambiguous characters (who may prove themselves to be not as ambiguous as originally thought) for a very, very long time. hoover says she ""chose the ending because it‚Äôs frightening to me. it‚Äôs my biggest nightmare for the darkness in the worlds i create as a writer to somehow"" intrude into her real life.thanks to grand central publishing for a copy of the book.",13-01-2022,1538724731,10,71,10.98,4.6,colleen hoover,2018,"thriller, romance, mystery, fiction",colleen,hoover,4,13,1,2022,Winter,1,Negatif,Pozitif,4

(spoilers)",alyshia,5,"o i loved this book, along with every other reader. however, it‚Äôs not my favorite book in the series (i‚Äôm writing this online review after completing the series but from the notes i took while reading for the first time).o we certainly do love a rhysand show, don‚Äôt we? we all made the mistake of liking tamlin in the first book, you‚Äôre not alone. i love rhys‚Äô character so much. brooding, bad boy with the good reasons. we love that.o overview: spoilers. feyre returned to the spring court with tamlin. only to find that tamlin had become so overprotective of her she wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave the manor. so she stayed there planning for everything with ianthe, the priestess that tamlin had brought in. planning the wedding, planning the flowers, things that she couldn‚Äôt have cared any less about. we find feyre falling more and more into the darkness. however, while she is there fighting with tamlin on everything, rhysand shows up to make good on his bargain after 3 months of peace where everyone assumed he‚Äôd forgotten about it. although she doesn‚Äôt want to go, she does. and there, she learns to read and write because rhys saw in the trials that she couldn‚Äôt. he teaches her with sentences like ‚Äúrhysand is the most handsome high lord‚Äù, and the like. we love that for him & his twisted sense of humor and narcissism.o however, feyre captures a suriel (our favorite gossip queen) and he tells her ‚Äústay with the high lord and see everything righted‚Äù so, the day of the wedding of tamlin and feyre (feeling like she is doing as the suriel told her) comes and she has a hideous dress that she hates on that ianthe picked out. as she is walking own the isle toward tamlin she is silently shouting in her head for anyone to stop it. she is beginning to panic. and a special dark knight in shining armor shows up just in time as feyre stopped in the aisle because she couldn‚Äôt go any further. rhys then whisks her away.o there she decides that she is not returning to the spring court and being locked in that house.o so begins feyre‚Äôs real healing at velaris and the night court.o i did indeed love this book so much. feyre‚Äôs internal struggle just fractured my heart throughout the entire thing. her spiraling into despair and tamlin not noticing but rhys noticing that she was coming to him during his weeks, frail and full of nothing was so amazing.o watching their characters develop a relationship was amazing. i understand why this book is the favorite of the entire series.",09-08-2023,1635575583,12,72,12.79,4.8,sarah j. maas,2016,"fantasy, romance, young adult, new adult, fiction",sarah,j. maas,7,9,8,2023,Summer,3,N√∂tr,Pozitif,7
"a court of mist and fury (a court of thorns and roses, 2)",all hail high lord rhys,bailee williams,4,"i really debated rating this one higher cause i gave acotar four stars and i definitely liked this one better, but it didn‚Äôt quite feel like a 4.5 or 5 star read. i‚Äôm so consistent üòÖanyway, getting into my actual thoughts‚Ä¶where do i find myself an illyrian? like, for real. how is it that rhys, cassian, and azriel are all the actual best.following the trend i‚Äôve seen, i love rhys, and tamlin can go rot in hell. that‚Äôs how much i disliked him in this book. i loved seeing how much under the mountain affected feyre, and i really liked all of her interactions with the inner circle. the inner circle in general is like actually the best part of this book.the. tension. is so freaking good. i think the tension itself was better than the spice (though the spice was üå∂Ô∏è ü•µüëå), but only because the tension was soooo damn good. it‚Äôs like 300 pages of tension and buildup and i was dying. but loving it. obviously.it was such a great fantasy read to jump into and finish within like 48 hours. though i am kicking myself for not having acowar already in my house before i finished this one. definitely make sure you have the whole series ready.spoiler talk:i wasn‚Äôt a fan of elaine and lucien being mates. like, first of all, i didn‚Äôt love lucien in this one, but also it just felt too ironic. and feyre has the same thought, but it doesn‚Äôt make it better üòÖi‚Äôm feeling a nesta and cassian mates plot line?? i don‚Äôt hate it, but it still feels weird that all three sisters randomly have mates that are in close proximity to each other.mor and azriel >>>the ending felt weird and maybe a little rushed? idk, the book just felt like a mcguffin, i don‚Äôt understand the deal with the cauldron, and i don‚Äôt know how much i love that feyre and rhys were able to trick the big bad villain so easily. it was just meh.also, what is with sjm and intentionally holding back major plot points from readers just to surprise us?? i was somewhat okay with it when it was just aelin doing it in tog, but i‚Äôm not a fan of it here. i‚Äôd rather know their plan and feel the suspense of ‚Äúcan they pull it off??‚Äù than being blindsided.",06-09-2023,1635575583,5,72,12.79,4.8,sarah j. maas,2016,"fantasy, romance, young adult, new adult, fiction",sarah,j. maas,7,6,9,2023,Autumn,3,Pozitif,Pozitif,7
"a court of mist and fury (a court of thorns and roses, 2)","the ending was stunning, as always, but i had character issues.",brittany,4,"** warning: this is not a spoiler-free review like i usually write. i won‚Äôt give away twists from the very end but i will be discussing things that happened throughout the beginning and middle of the book! **i was pleasantly surprised when i read a court of thorns and roses last year because going into it, i knew it was a story with a strong fae presence. by this point in time in my reading career, i wasn‚Äôt new to fantasy but i was still a bit picky about what sort of fantasy i liked and fae did not fall into that category of selected themes‚Ä¶ but knowing how much i loved sarah‚Äôs throne of glass series and the fae presence there, i dove into acotar and loved it! it had a bit of a breaking dawn ending so i wasn‚Äôt quite sure where the second book would go but naturally i had very, very high hopes for it since i hadn‚Äôt been let down by a maas book yet!i won‚Äôt sugar coat it ‚Äî it actually took me a really long time to get into the swing of this book. i was enjoying the plot but the beginning felt so incredibly dramatic and i just didn‚Äôt feel like things were moving forward. there was a lot of time spent on feyre‚Äôs ptsd from her time under the mountain and i absolutely understand and don‚Äôt think that her traumatic experience should be just brushed over. i do felt like there was too much time dwelling on it though. acomaf isn‚Äôt a short book and i think some pages could have been saved and still gotten the point across throughout a few sections in the beginning. if the book were more character-based instead of plot-driven, it might have been more appropriate but the plot really seemed to suffer because of this and this isn‚Äôt the first time i felt this way in a maas book either. i understand that these characters have gone through something that truly does change them but i felt like i was reading about totally different characters when i started acomaf. feyre and tamlin were just not themselves and i think had acotar ended with a bit more of this shadow or if it had slowly creeped in throughout acomaf, it wouldn‚Äôt have been as much of a surprise. i just really felt like i was thrown into a totally new environment and it was really hard for me to adjust to, especially since i had read acotar over a year before i got to start acomaf.i continued to have issues with feyre throughout the book. i don‚Äôt know why but she was just really bothering me. instead of snarky, witty comebacks, i felt like everything with her was taken as an insult and she was constantly being defensive and kind of hated everyone. it was really hard to watch her interact with characters and i started to latch onto new (or new-to-the-spotlight) characters like rhysand and his gang. it did make me extra thankful for rhys coming onto the scene and shaking things up, though! the interactions between feyre and tamlin were just unbearable and painful to read. then i ended up on the flip side where although i didn‚Äôt want feyre and tamlin to still be together, i also felt really weird that tamlin was almost totally absent from this book. he was there in the beginning and i won‚Äôt speak of the ending but this book was straight up about feyre and rhysand and it almost felt like a waste that we spent all that time building up a romance between feyre and tamlin in acotar to have it totally change. i absolutely love where it went but it‚Äôs confusing to understand why the feyre/tamlin romance was so important and developed in acotar and why rhysand wasn‚Äôt more of a main character throughout that courtship to really get his foot even more in the door.i‚Äôve followed the romances in sarah j. maas‚Äô books quite well, i think, considering they‚Äôre not always simple and straightforward. i know some people who have issues with love triangles or already have their otps with the first love interest really have trouble moving with the characters as they fall out of love or move from one interest to realize that their true match is someone else and i feel like i‚Äôve followed along with that fairly easily. i can see where people feel like the romance in acomaf is a love triangle and i guess to a certain extent it is, but feyre also does not have interest in both men at the same time. it is quite complicated though so if you‚Äôre sensitive about triangles, you almost definitely won‚Äôt like the romance.i personally loved the development of rhysand as a love interest, especially once feyre really started to struggle with tamlin. i found it telling that at the hardest points in their lives, feyre and tamlin drifted apart and just couldn‚Äôt find a way to even communicate instead of being able to rely on one another and get through a hard time together. that doesn‚Äôt always mean that you shouldn‚Äôt be with someone but in the case of story telling, it‚Äôs a pretty big sign that the main character isn‚Äôt where they should be. i‚Äôve heard this complaint from other maas readers but this is the first of her books where i really felt like the romance started to take over the book. while i did love the new rhysand/feyre development, i felt like there was a lot of back and forth between them before anything major (finally) happened and that could have been cut down to some more meaningful interactions instead of repetitive, similar situations that happened more than a few times throughout the course of the story. their romance actually is a very important part of the plot so it‚Äôs not like i wanted it to be downplayed but i just felt like so many points of the large general story were pushed aside to develop the romantic moments and it started to turn more romance story than epic fantasy ‚Äî and yes, there are some cheesy romance book-worthy moments. let‚Äôs just say this is not a young adult book, friends. there are some very explicit scenes so if you have teens or are directing/teaching teens who are reading this series, you may not want to put this book directly into their hands. (not that i‚Äôm saying censor them but. ya know. read it first so you know what you‚Äôre giving them.)the sections where the plot progressed were really quite delightful. sarah j. maas is still a master at layering stories and it‚Äôs so interesting to see how much of a previous book comes back in a different light in a subsequent book. there were so many moments that the reader is able to recognize from acomaf and see from a different character‚Äôs perspective or reassess it with more information and it makes the story that much deeper! once things started to really take off around halfway through and a little thereafter, the book was simply addicting and i couldn‚Äôt wait to see where the entire plot of the series was going! sarah really does have an amazing ability to craft an overall series arc and it‚Äôs so fun to watch that develop. the ending positively floored me and it was hard to remember why i had been so frustrated for a while throughout earlier sections of the book. so many things were revealed, actions taken, and trusts betrayed that i just really didn‚Äôt know what was coming. the twists and surprises were epic and once again, i was left in utter anticipation of the next book!",29-06-2016,1635575583,11,72,12.79,4.8,sarah j. maas,2016,"fantasy, romance, young adult, new adult, fiction",sarah,j. maas,7,29,6,2016,Summer,2,Pozitif,Pozitif,0
"a court of mist and fury (a court of thorns and roses, 2)","i was a survivor, and i was strong. i would not be weak, or helpless again.",mikee andrea quiambao,5,"*review originally posted on goodreads*‚ùùi was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. i was a survivor, and i was strong. i would not be weak, or helpless again. i would not, could not be broken. tamed.‚ùûa court of thorns and roses was one of the first books i started reading that got me into fantasy and reviewing books. way back when this series, the throne of glass series, and sarah j. maas, herself, wasn't hyped up like there's no tomorrow. it was the first book i've read by sarah j. maas and the reason i picked up the throne of glass series because i just needed more sjm in my life.i was satisfied with the way things ended in acotar so when i heard that some ""changes"" were going to be made in a court of mist and fury, i was a little disappointed. i was not a fan of the changes that were made in the throne of glass series which was why i haven't picked up queen of shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it's been released. that's just my opinion. i know some sjm fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that sarah could absolutely do no wrong. don't get me wrong, i love sarah j. maas. she is an outstanding author. i love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. it was her books that changed my perspective on young adult fantasy, but i honestly wouldn't say that i agree with every direction that sjm takes with her books.i suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of acotar and how did i perceive the changes that were made after reading acomaf?let me address the most important aspect of sarah j. maas's books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: the romance. since a court of thorns and roses was a loose retelling of beauty and the beast, my ship of course was none other than tamlin and feyre. i loved them as individuals and i loved them even more as a couple. and i loved rhysand. just not as a love interest. i felt like feyre wasn't worthy of the enigma that was rhysand. but knowing the trend that sjm follows in all of her books, i figured a change in love interests was inevitable. after all, a book isn't written by sarah j. maas if there isn't some character butchering and changes in love interests involved.but after reading a court of mist and fury, i actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. as much as i wanted tamlin and feyre to stay together, i knew it wasn't going to happen. these two people that survived weren't the same people that were under the mountain. they're relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. it was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen.in the beginning of this series, i understood where tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of feyre. it was for feyre's own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. but he took it way too far. he became too overbearing to the point where he was holding feyre back. we all understood the trials and suffering that feyre had to go through but i feel like people don't acknowledge what tamlin had to go through as well while they were under the mountain. it was nothing close to what feyre had to go through but tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. he couldn't protect her the way he wanted and he didn't fight for her as he knew he very well could have. he was helpless and a coward. i think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she's being suffocated. it still doesn't excuse what tamlin does in this book but he's just another damaged character like feyre and rhysand. he's just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. tamlin loves feyre, that much is evident. he just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy.as for rhysand, all i can say is that i loved him in acotar and i loved him even more in a court of mist and fury. i loved that we finally get a good understanding of rhys as a character, the secrets he's kept, and the sacrifices he's made for the good of his people and his court. he was everything that tamlin was not and twice the man and high lord that tamlin will ever be. i'm not completely sure if i'm 100% on board with feyre and rhysand yet but i love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. i think i would've been head over heels in love with feyre and rhys instantly as a couple if acotar never happened and i didn't get so attached to feyre and tamlin. but i no longer ship tamlin/feyre and i'm slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with rhysand and feyre little by little.with romance aside, everything about a court of mist and fury turned out every bit as great as i anticipated a year ago. sarah j. maas did not disappoint. i was preparing myself for the worst but instead i got the best. sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the night court were definitely my favorite. i thought the spring court was great in acotar with characters like lucien and alis but the night court was at a whole new level with cassian, azriel, morrigan, and amren. badass is literally an understatement describing these new characters.besides rhysand and feyre, acomaf introduced so many new ships and i can't handle all the perfectness that everyone is. i now ship mor and azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. xd and cassian and nesta. and lucian and elain. none for you tamlin.overall, i was glad i waited to read a court of mist and fury because as a result, i was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that sarah j. maas was taking the series. love her or hate her, sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author. although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow, i think a court of mist and fury was even better than acotar in more ways than one. sometimes i find that sequels may suffer ""middle book syndrome"" but acomaf amplifies that momentum knowing that sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the a court of thorns and roses

"a court of mist and fury (a court of thorns and roses, 2)",rhysand + you = hurry up and read this book!,amazon customer,5,"this book was everything i had hoped it would, and so much more! i loved it as much as i love rhysland. there, i said it. there's romance, sensuality, character growth, action, betrayal, friendships, family ties, and so much more. the character developments, the story telling, the world building, and the way maas wrote this story is awesome! this book is the packaged deal. okay, i'll admit it, rhysand is the packaged deal in this book.i knew there was much more to rhysand than we got to know in a court of thorns and roses. boy is there a lot more to him! i loved the way i got to know him in this book. maas held things back from readers, allowing us to get to know rhysand as feyre got to know him. part of that is what made it easier to fall in love with his character. the more i got to know him, the easier it was for me to really see him for who he was, and in turn made it easy to see the differences between him and tamlin. rhysland is that character you want on your side. he's loyal to those close to him, doesn't apologize for who he really is, doesn't hold back when it comes to loving a certain someone, and unlike some characters, he sees feyre for all that she really is, and allows her to be who she is, and all that she's becoming.despite the fact he can make anyone do anything he wants, rhysland gives feyre choices, and allows her to make them. he wants her to be who she wants to be. rhysand a character that readers will get to see all sides of, and fall in love with in the process. i love the way he treats feyre, and his court. he's very powerful, someone to fear, yet for all the darkness that resides within him, i came to understand how the darkness he has calms and brings peace to feyre. he is that person who isn't only compassionate and loyal when it comes to his court, he's someone who knows how to treat to a woman. he treats feyre with so much love, respect and understanding. *sigh* just wait until you see how he treats her... you won't be able to resist falling for him either. i've completely fallen in love with his character.feyre by all means is an equal to rhys. not only did i love their banter, electric chemistry, and those hot scenes between them ( i swear the pages ignited in this book more than a few times), i loved how she fell for rhysand. the more i got to know him, the more i understood how she slowly started to fall for him. it was natural and made sense. most importantly, i loved that she realized she is worth so much more than she's ever thought. i loved that she grew into a strong, fierce character/women who not only learned to love herself, but love someone who truly loved her, and didn't want to keep her in a cage. i loved that she learned to fight, and embrace her powers, both literally and figuratively. she grew so much, and i loved that she became a force to reckon with. what i admired the most about feyre's character development in this book, is that she learned to love herself. she learned to embrace who she is, and all that she is. i respected her even more for that.the romance and character chemistry in this book was on fire! the banter, and flirting between rhysand and feyre was, well that's just say these two know how to push each other's buttons, and get under each other's skin in all the right ways. together, feyre and rhysland are something amazing. aside from all the physical aspects, and passion these two share, i love that they chase away the darkness that threatens to consume the other. they both have experienced horrific things that they are still dealing with. they are each other's hope, and light. they're there for each other and help pull each other out of the darkness, or sometimes are there to hold the other as they endure the nightmares.one of the things i liked about theme of love in this book, is the way feyre came to realize what it truly meant to be loved and be in love, vs what she thought love was. i appreciated the fact that maas doesn't just tell her readers this, she shows us through character actions. we see it through feyre's realization of what rhysand's been telling her, and how he treats her vs how tamlin treats her. tamlin's fall from grace is that he didn't respect feyre enough to allow her to be herself. he didn't treat her like an equal, but instead wanted keep her locked up and in his possession. i may have got the 'why' in that, but i didn't agree with it at all. the contrast between how rhysand and tamlin both treated feyre was painfully obvious through out the book.maas has a way with creating in-depth characters i really come to care about. she effortlessly brings them to life, as well as their stories, and vividly detailed worlds. i loved getting to go deeper into the fey world, being introduced to more characters, and seeing the different parts of their world. i loved getting to know the night court. maas has always created characters that really add depth to the story, and the night court was no different. i loved meeting and getting to know rhys's inner circle. these characters weren't only friends, they are family, and it really showed in their story. along with the night court, which has become my favorite court, i loved seeing more of the other characters, and learning about their histories, and ties together with their courts. i felt every range of emotion possible while reading this book. i laughed, i cried, i cheered, i swooned, got swept off my feet, was happy, angry (at a certain someone), and i completely fell in love with all that this book offered me. i officially have a book hang over. sarah j. maas what have you done to me?! the turn of events, the character developments, and the over all story are that good! i feel bad for the next book i read after this one, because i already had to re-read this book once, because it was so good. i don't even know what else i can say, other than, that is one heck of an awesome sequel! now the torture will be waiting a whole another for the next book!*there are sensual scenes, and well written sex scenes through out the book, as well as the use of the f-word a few times through out the book, making it a book that may not be suitable for younger ya readers.",26-05-2016,1635575583,10,72,12.79,4.8,sarah j. maas,2016,"fantasy, romance, young adult, new adult, fiction",sarah,j. maas,7,26,5,2016,Spring,2,N√∂tr,Pozitif,0

includes:1. things we never got over (knox morgan & naomi witt‚Äôs story)2. things we hide from the light (nash morgan & lina solavita‚Äôs story)3. things we left behind (lucian rollins & sloane walton‚Äôs story)named after a fictional small town in northern virginia, the series is full of lively characters, outrageous banter, and lots of steamy chemistry. there are adorable pets and kids that steal your heart. there is also a dose of danger brewing in the background. geographically, it likely matches up with either real-life western loudoun or clarke county, virginia. although the town is vibrant and attracts visitors from nearby washington, d.c., knockemout retains its sense of history and a strong feeling of community. it is rumored that the town was named to reflect the way its citizens have long worked out their problems ‚Äì the good old-fashioned way. they fight it out and move on. the town is like a big extended family, with troublemakers, problem-solvers, and a charitable spirit.in this book:the story opens in august.naomi witt, thirty-six, is the quintessential good girl. a natural caretaker, she never wants to be a burden to others and always puts herself last. she hadn‚Äôt anticipated the last-minute road trip to virginia that brought her to knockemout. she was supposed to be on her honeymoon with warner. she is a planner, so the change in plans put her way out of her comfort zone. she has a five-year plan and relies upon a plethora of lists to keep her life on track. she bought a home on long island worthy of raising a family and had worked in hr for warner‚Äôs family‚Äôs investment firm for five years. their four years together as a couple and two years planning the perfect wedding had all been for nothing, though. she tried to be everything to warner, but she lost herself in the process. she realized her mistake at the last minute, and an unexpected phone call gave her the motivation she needed.faced with a crisis of her own, naomi nevertheless dropped everything when she received her estranged twin sister‚Äôs call for help. the timing gave her a place to secretly run away to as well as a distraction. always the people pleaser, naomi likes to fix problems. her sister tina has always been trouble, but naomi never anticipated what was waiting for her in virginia. in the year tina had lived in knockemout, she had managed to build herself quite a reputation, and as an identical twin, naomi soon finds herself reaping the results. she doesn‚Äôt find many friendly faces.naomi doesn‚Äôt find her sister, but she does end up as tina‚Äôs latest victim. after having lived through the worst day of her life, the next day isn‚Äôt looking much better. stuck without a phone, car, or credit card, she is dependent upon the kindness of others. yet nothing could have prepared her for the discovery that tina had left behind an eleven-year-old daughter ‚Äì a niece naomi never knew existed. doing right by her is never a question. waylay is tough like her mother, but behind the hard exterior might just be a pre-teen desperate for some normalcy. she is whip-smart but guarded, and naomi knows that earning waylay‚Äôs trust will be a huge challenge.naomi is stuck in knockemout for at least six months while the custodial arrangement works its way through the legal system. her entire world pivots as her sense of control is challenged. all of her plans for the future are in upheaval, leaving her adrift with uncertainty. as the locals begin to know naomi as not tina, she begins to settle in. however, there is one particular grumpy viking of a man that drives her crazy and sets her body on fire at the same time. he is rude and infuriating, and his bad-boy vibe is completely the opposite of warner's. almost from the time she rode into town, this man has put himself in the middle of her business, but the last thing she needs with waylay's custody in limbo is trouble.knox morgan, forty-three, is his own man. his good looks, beard, and tattoos give him the quintessential bad-boy vibe, so women love him in spite of his prickly personality. he does what he wants, when he wants, and he wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. rules are for people like his brother nash, knockemout‚Äôs chief of police. they have a long history of fighting, but they always made up, too. that changed about three years ago, and things haven‚Äôt been the same between them since. it breaks their grandmother‚Äôs heart. she raised the boys after their mother died, and now what's left of their family is in shambles.knox knows good things never last, so anything more than a casual relationship has never been on the table for him. he doesn‚Äôt like strings, and he moves on at the first sign of an attachment. he hasn‚Äôt been with a local girl since high school, to the disappointment of many. when he is in the mood for a good chase, he heads out of town for a night or two of fun and pleasure. the routine has grown tiresome, though, which might explain his irresistible attraction to a certain newcomer. little miss daisies in her hair is not his type at all. she is uppity and needy, and her vocabulary is too big. he hates that he wants her so badly, but if he cannot have her, nobody can ‚Äì his brother nash in particular.knox came into money a few years back, but he didn‚Äôt take it for granted. he has carefully managed his growing portfolio of local businesses, increasing his net worth. he co-owns whiskey clipper with his long-time good friend jeremiah, whose vision has paid off big time. the old barber shop was transformed into a salon that now draws clientele from d.c. a proud barber, people go out of their way to sit in knox‚Äôs chair. he spends most of his time doing managerial work for his various businesses, though. when his business manager, sherry fiasco, hires naomi behind his back, he realizes that he is in deep trouble. the last thing he needs every day is to see naomi waitressing at honky tonk, his bar.knox and naomi have instant chemistry, but things get off to bad start when he confuses her with her delinquent sister. naomi doesn‚Äôt appreciate being yelled at, and she is tired of always playing nice. despite his intimidating presence, she pushes back, catching knox and everyone around him off guard. their crazy banter soon becomes entertainment for the locals. denying their attraction to one another eventually proves to be harder than giving in to temptation. knox is stubbornly stuck in his ways, and naomi is just trying to get by. they agree that whatever they have is a temporary tryst, but then things get complicated. neither is ready for a relationship. things move quickly in their rocky ride, but they eventually earn their happy ending.don‚Äôt forget to download the free bonus epilogue via the link at the back of the book!book two, things we hide from the light, follows, in which knox‚Äôs brother nash gets his happy ending with lina. they meet here, in book one.book three, things we left behind, also gets a brief preview here as lucian and sloane‚Äôs backstory is hinted at.wow! knox and naomi‚Äôs story is a fabulous read. the characters and their trendy northern virginia town come to life in vivid detail and spectacular dialogue. their story really sticks with you, and you‚Äôll quickly be reaching for book two so that you can continue to immerse yourself in the knockemout world. there were eleven laugh-out-loud moments by my count as well as countless witty excerpts scattered throughout. i also came across eight teary scenes. the couple‚Äôs chemistry drips off the page, too.knox and naomi are opposites in so many ways. knox is gruff and intimidating, while naomi is kind and well-mannered. knox wears tattoos and doesn‚Äôt always stay within the law, while naomi wears sundresses and always follows the rules. knox pushes people away, whereas people are naturally drawn to naomi. despite first appearances, however, they actually do have a lot in common. knox may keep people at a distance, but he is all about giving back. he loves his town, his employees, his friends, and his family, even if he doesn‚Äôt know how to express it. his intentions are easily misconstrued since he is generally so unpleasant. naomi‚Äôs selfless personality is more obvious, which makes her a prime target for manipulation. their shared concern for waylay‚Äôs welfare gives them a distraction from their incessant arguing. it gives them an opening that might not have occurred otherwise because knox‚Äôs general grouchiness sets the otherwise pleasant daisy off. he triggers something wild and untamed in her ‚Äì an attribute she abhors.there are a few issues that merit mention. first, there are some timeline issues. there is some inconsistency and vagueness that occasionally causes confusion. i looked back several times to verify but had to make assumptions of my own. my takeaway is that the story opened about 2.5 weeks prior to the first day of school, which would be early august, and the story runs its course by october. the bonus epilogue gives a quick peek at the couple with their family and friends five years down the road. second, knox‚Äôs relationships are supposedly short-lived and casual, but later there are a few statements that make it sound as if he has had a history of actual relationships ‚Äì implying something more than casual hookups when in fact he always walks away before it gets that far. third, there is a point at which i couldn‚Äôt understand why naomi hadn‚Äôt moved. she had the funds and it would have been appropriate given developments. fourth, lina‚Äôs nearly two-decade friendship with knox post-breakup didn‚Äôt feel credible to me. i would have expected her to lose interest at some point and stop making the effort. further, the fact that she never met nash in almost twenty years of friendship is not at all credible. nash and knox have a history of fighting, but it is only the last three years that they‚Äôve not been able to make up. that lina walks into knox‚Äôs establishment like it is nothing shows knox has actually brought his out-of-town girlfriends home, or at the very least, he has hung out with lina in his hometown. in a town that thrives on gossip, that friendship would have been rumored to be more and it would have gotten back to nash, without a doubt. he would have made it his business to meet her. finally, i was surprised at naomi‚Äôs outreach to tina after so much concern about safety had been voiced. it was used to further the plot, but it made naomi look thoughtless.knox and naomi‚Äôs riotous romance will have you in stitches, but don‚Äôt forget the tissues. fans of nicole snow will love the witty humor and writing style here. coffee lovers will delight and dog lovers will drool in this darling story. naomi is a runaway bride who finds herself heated once tattooed viking knox starts yelling and telling her what to do. their enemies-to-lovers one-night-stand transforms into a fake relationship once things get complicated. the story is smartly written. it is a page-turner from the start, although it does slow down a bit in the second half. the plot is fairly simple. knockemout comes to life in this story. the characters are wonderfully defined, and the couple‚Äôs romantic tension is palpable. there is a large cast of colorful and unique characters. the story is told in first person. the pov alternates between knox and naomi. i rate this book 4.5

things we never got over (knockemout),"grumpy ml, strong female lead, romance, heartfelt & more!",briana bailon,5,"grumpy man who is unable to stop thinking about woman, said woman‚Äôs life turning upside down after her twin sister stole her money, car, and then found out she had an eleven year old niece! talk about a lot going on for naomi witt. this story had everything i could possibly want and more from the grumpiness of knox, naomi trying to figure out the whirlwind mess that became her life, and somehow in the mist of all the drama, love found a way, and there were some added heartfelt moments as well as funny moments too!right from the start, naomi had just come out of a big mess, but just when she thought things couldn‚Äôt get any worse, her twin sister tina, stole all of naomi‚Äôs things, and left her to care for her niece, waylay, who she didn‚Äôt even know existed. add into the mix the ever so grumpy and tough knox, who seemed to not only make naomi angry, but frustrated both mentally and physically *wink, wink. knox seemed annoyed yet somehow fascinated by naomi from the way she carried herself to low key checking out her facebook to see everything about her, to having some spicy dreams about naomi that left him wanting her in ways he had never felt before. not to mention, knox downright telling naomi to her face that she wasn‚Äôt his ‚Äútype‚Äù haha very funny knox because based off the way he acted towards her throughout the story would seem otherwise. so you could only imagine the tension that occurred between naomi and knox was both a pleasure and entertaining to watch unfold.i loved seeing naomi adapt to the new changes in her life a.k.a. trying to care of waylay and trying to be the best guardian she could be for her, especially since tina (waylay‚Äôs mom) never cared for her, and treated her badly. naomi wasn‚Äôt the only one who cared for waylay, but also knox, nash, liza j, and naomi‚Äôs parents, and the whole town of knockemout. having those people rally around waylay and provide her with both love and support was so heartwarming to see. plus you could tell that waylay appreciated having that sense of true family around her since she never really had that to begin with. naomi struggled in the beginning trying to grapple with ways to connect with waylay, and provide her with all the necessities she could possibly need and want. thankfully with the residential grumpy man that was knox, he definitely went above and beyond to help naomi with waylay.through the drama that came with tina and trying to make sure waylay was taken care of, naomi had a lot on her plate, but somehow during all of it, she caught the eye of knox. what i found so amusing with knox was that he was aware that he was grumpy and *cough a bit rude to naomi, but what also made me laugh was that he would sometimes complain about constantly thinking about naomi or felt kind of annoyed having to pull her out of trouble. in all honesty though, knox wanted to help out naomi because he genuinely wanted to be there for her. if anything, knox wasn‚Äôt use to the feelings that naomi brought out in him, and therefore resorted to being his grumpy self and blamed his body‚Äôs reaction to only wanting naomi in a purely physical way. haha joke was on knox because based off the chemistry he and naomi had, their connection went beyond just physical. while i will say, the passion between those two was amazing (especially reading it!) the spice, the dirty talk, and pure wanting lust between was‚Ä¶ whoa! and of course we can‚Äôt forget how demanding and possessive knox was over naomi.in addition, i loved how knox became sort of naomi‚Äôs unofficial yet official caretaker, provider in a way. naomi was so use to taking care of everyone from always cleaning up tina‚Äôs messes to literally doing everything for ex in her previous relationship, naomi did it all! knox saw that naomi always put others needs before her own, and he wanted to be the one to take care of naomi. something in the pit of knox‚Äôs gut just had this natural instinct of protection over naomi, wanted to be her ‚Äúhero‚Äù.this story was absolutely amazing! i loved that with each chapter, i was drawn in more by the characters, the plot, and the overall feeling i got while reading. i couldn‚Äôt put this book down, and if i wasn‚Äôt reading it, i was thinking about it constantly! i especially loved the tight knit community that was in knockemout. how everyone helped one another, came together as a community, and the overall support everyone provided for naomi and waylay. this story captured my heart, naomi and knox definitely had some bumps in the road, but they ultimately had their ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù. just when i thought the story ended on a beautiful note, the epilogue& bonus epilogue had me weeping tears of joy. do yourself a favor and read this book.",08-03-2022,194563183x,9,83,8.93,4.5,lucy score,2022,"romance, contemporary, contemporary romance, fiction, adult, chick lit",lucy,score,8,8,3,2022,Spring,1,Pozitif,Pozitif,0

things we never got over (knockemout),i didn‚Äôt like knox,ash,4,"3.5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è slight spoilers if you haven‚Äôt read this‚Ä¶this was my second time reading twngo. the first time i probably would have given 5 stars. the me that read it a second time didn‚Äôt love it as much. i still loved it but my least fav part of the book was knox, the mmc. he‚Äôs a toxic jerk. i‚Äôm all for a broody, grumpy lead guy but he was beyond that for me. the third act breakup was fine for me except that he was getting her naked while formulating a plot to break her heart. cringe. i don‚Äôt mind third act breakups but him going from one extreme (breaking up with her) to telling her(not asking her)they were getting married was‚Ä¶ idk i just didn‚Äôt love it. i‚Äôm not a knox fan this time around. sorry.i do like naomi though. i feel like the coffee part of her personality went a little too far when that was her first word after she almost died buuuut i still mostly liked her. her storyline with her niece, waylay, was the best parts of this book, in my opinion. i love waylay. (side note: that teacher who messed with way deserved to be fired, among other things, not retired.)the secondary characters were also great. i love stef, lucian, and sloane. i liked lina enough that i‚Äôm hoping the second book will win me over! i do still like this book overall. i love lucy score. it just hit me a little different than the first time i read it.",07-09-2023,194563183x,4,83,8.93,4.5,lucy score,2022,"romance, contemporary, contemporary romance, fiction, adult, chick lit",lucy,score,8,7,9,2023,Autumn,3,Pozitif,Pozitif,1
things we never got over (knockemout),really great book about trauma and choosing love over fear! book is too long though,ncr,4,"the book gave me that sad, nostalgic feeling of ""wow that was a really beautiful book.""1) the book is a beautiful story about overcoming trauma - specifically fears about falling in love. this happens for a lot of books (i'm thinking ugly love as another popular romance book). but really this book has realistic trauma situations and there are so many pages that you really see the characters change and unravel from their pain points. so by the end, i really understood the two main characters (there are alternating chapter povs!). the author explained in the note at the end that some of her friends had some tragedies happen to them while she was writing this book, and that helped her realize this book would be about choosing to love even when you know it could hurt. it's definitely the message and theme of this book so it's super good in that way. this book doubles as a therapy session tbh. in the world of mental health/relationship psychology, i would highly recommend this book. you're basically watching an anxious-avoidant relationship both become more secure (hence the title of the book: things we never got over)2) this book is too long. i'm really not kidding. the first 20 chapters should have been cut in half like at best. the author said in the author's note she did not know what the book would be about when she wrote it, i kinda see that still. it's just a lot of romance building and when i tell you the second half of the book is sooo strong with all the conflict and juicy drama, the length of first half was not needed. like not needed. as someone who reads a lot of scripts for shows/movies, i am a big fan that every word on a page as a writer should be earned, and so much of the beginning was truly boring to the plot. i am impressed by the original readers who kept on going and then gave the book high reviews. i truly just kept on reading because this book was talked about so much that i had to see the hype. in hindsight, i would have read a summary online for the first half of the book and then skipped to chapter 21 and started reading the book from then on. still would have been an over 300-page book to read.3) this should be an exciting series! the author interweaves other characters' love lives so there will be more books in the future that let us see these other characters fall in love. i am so excited cause lucy and sloane brought the heat that sometimes i was more engaged in their bickering than in noami and knox's.4) there's sunshine / grumpy love and then there's like good girl submissive energy / bad boy dominant energy love and this relationship is more the latter. grumpy guy's usually aren't rude to the actual girl (they are more like thoughtful grumpies...like adam carlsen or luke danes). this guy at the beginning was just straight rude to the female lead. i was like now what the heck. and home girl had like no backbone to him, for 90% of this book. like he straight disrespected her many times so i wasn't really into him as a character. i just have a distate for men treating women like garbage but then buying them gifts and so its supposed to be okay? (um no.) until of course then in the end i got more proud of him over time, but to me he's definitely a guy where he's not really my type. (but for those who read the book, i'm probably more of a girl like sloane.) so yes just a heads up for readers, it's more of the good girl / bad boy chemistry.5) lots of relationship psychology and psycho-analyzing. sometimes i liked it, other times i felt that the author copied and pasted therapy quotes online and put them into the book. as in it was very generic quotes about choosing love over fear. this book is full of a lot of emotionally unintelligent grown adults being told things they should have learned in their 20s. how have both of the leads not worked through their relationship patterns by now or been told them before? these are conversations people usually have in their 20s, but it might just be a generational thing that people are learning how to heal later. but just a heads up that characters are being told advice that seemed very young to hear for their age. they easily could have been in their 20s in terms of their behavior.overall:really great book about trauma and choosing love over fear! way too long of a book, really strong second half, and would highly recommend it if you like good girl/bad boy love tropes or like relationship psychology since there is a lot of relationship psycho-analyzing that the characters do with each other.",06-07-2022,194563183x,15,83,8.93,4.5,lucy score,2022,"romance, contemporary, contemporary romance, fiction, adult, chick lit",lucy,score,8,6,7,2022,Summer,3,Pozitif,Pozitif,0

the ballad of songbirds and snakes (a hunger games novel) (the hunger games),this is not a hero story,anne pruitt,5,"4.5 starsamazon delivered my copy early, so i'm going to do a spoiler free review and then a spoilery one. pardon if this winds up sounding like an english paper. i have thought so much on the morals and questions in this book that i feel like i should have read this in school.note: i'm writing this review with the express belief that you, reader, have at least read the book description. otherwise why are you reading this review?i want to start this off by saying two things. one, this is not a hero story. snow is never once, in my opinion, shown to be a hero in this in what we modern folks would call a hero. he's no luke skywalker or redeemed villain. this isn't some sob backstory to explain ""why the bad guy is bad."" this is yet another set of layers to the onion that is snow.second, this book is dark. it's been a minute since i read the original trilogy, but i swear it wasn't quite as graphic as this book was. cannibalism is mentioned, and it's shown/talked about that someone sawed the leg off a dead woman and ran off with it. one character is killed then hung on a hook and paraded. another is also gruesomely displayed after their death. several characters are dragged through processions to ""prove a point,"" another character is hung from two large poles and left to basically die in the sun. multiple accounts of vomiting/poison throughout, and a general unpleasantness at the lack of regard for human life.non-spoilery review:this book makes you think. a lot. it makes you question things, and wonder if maybe snow is right (he's not), but it's written in such a way that he's not a villain. donald sutherland in an interview made a great point in saying that snow isn't a villain, he's just a ruthless man doing what he thinks is right to keep his home and country in one piece.""he does it so well. and he doesn't think he's a bad person. he thinks it's the only way society can survive. and whether you think he's right or wrong, he doesn't think he's bad. he likes himself.""this should be the mantra for this book. snow is a conflicting, flawed human. in our society, he's evil, a sociopath or a psychopath. he's a murderer and a killer. he's a bad guy. in his world, he's one of the masses. he simply lives as he's been raised to, with a mentality that has been ingrained in him since the war between the districts and the capitol. he's simply more ruthless then most and has the guts to make what he considers the ""hard decisions.""regardless of the other characters in this, they're all props to his story--which fits well with the snow we know from the hunger games. everyone is second stage to snow and his life. this is his evolution from being a child to a man, to becoming the snow we know and love/hate.i definitely don't think this book is for everyone. i'm sitting here with my mom breathing down my neck because she can't wait to read it, and i don't think she'll like it at all, and she's a diehard thg trilogy fan. why? because not everyone likes to read depressing books. there's no redemption in this. there's no saving someone from themselves. this is the fall, stumble, plummet into being a not great person and embracing it fully.so take that as you will. full spoilers below about everything.p.s. this is a standalone.spoilers belowokay, so, i was worried about this book when i read the first chapter sample and it got announced that snow would be training the district 12 girl. i thought, oh crap, it's gonna be a cliche ya. it's gonna have a stupid romance that undercuts the whole plot and makes him a sap. and yeah, it did that, and up until the last 50 pages i was teetering on a 3-3.5 stars. and then oh boy, the end.lucy grey was a sweet girl, but she felt off since the beginning. i still can't fully put my finger on it, but her and snow's relationship felt so <i>wrong</i> the entirety of the book. the red flags went up repeatedly every time he made comments about how she was his, and even so far as to say she was his property, and that's all kinds of wrong. and even though their romance was cute and fluffy, it felt bad, tainted. you knew something was going to happen. it always does in these villain backstories. usually the whole reason the villain is bad is because the love interest gets brutally killed and then they're like whelp, guess i'll just be evil.not in this book.snow constantly struggles with morality and right and wrong throughout this. should he turn in his friend to the capitol because they're colluding with rebels and could tear down the (flawed) infrastructure? or should he turn a blind eye and let his friend do his own thing? is the hunger games wrong or good? is it wrong to view the district people as second class humans? and so on. this book broaches the topic of racism in very broad terms with the whole district/capitol thing. you've always known there was a divide between them, but in this, you really see how much the capitol looks down on the districts, and you can easily see how that morphs into such a hatred and distaste by the time katniss first enters the hunger games.but i digress. snow struggles with morality, but he's flawed and very, very imperfect. he rationalizes every death he takes as self-defense or some other reason when really he's just murdered someone because it's inconvenient for him. he kills (or at least removes her from the picture; it's ambiguous) lucy grey in the end because she's a loose end and too free. he does it. not someone else, not some freak accident. he chooses to do it and, by the time it happens, you already know what direction he's headed in so it's not quite another nail in the coffin. it fully feels like him tying up loose ends so he can go do whatever he wants.all the nods to thg characters and names was cool. you also had a lot of the great gatsby vibes in the old money versus new money mentality that a lot of the capitol had with district people who gained a fortune and bought their way into the capitol life. they're looked down upon by the old families and viewed as trash.you saw a lot of the evolution in the hunger games, and you can see how it begins to change and grow into what katniss and peeta suffered through. you see how it begins to change from a simple punishment to a sport and a holiday, with the growing encouragement that it should be a normal and good thing.you also see a side of the capitol you most definitely did not see in the trilogy--suffering. a lot of the book shows snow struggling with having been a small child living through the dark days and the war. he was 8 when the capitol won, and even then it was hard. you learn about the hell the capitol lived through as they were besieged by the districts' army and forced to ration, starvation, and cannibalism. it's a hard picture, and it's so blatantly told. collins didn't hold back any punches in this. i never felt like what was done was for shock and awe for the reader, but it was definitely that for the story, and it made sense. regardless of the capitol not being at war with the districts anymore, the tensions were still so high that it makes sense for the capitol to overreact in their retaliation of events. so when one mentor gets killed by her tribute, they shoot the tribute and parade her body around on a hook at the mentor's funeral. it's disgusting, debasing, and shows how much the capitol views the districts as nothing more than rodents or livestock.anyway, i'll stop talking. go read it yourself. it's a hard read, a heavy read, but it was very, very enjoyable.",24-05-2020,1338635174,6,87,15.79,4.6,suzanne collins,2020,"adventure, war, science fiction, romance, action, thriller",suzanne,collins,7,24,5,2020,Spring,2,Negatif,Negatif,0
the ballad of songbirds and snakes (a hunger games novel) (the hunger games),"ted bundy, coriolanus and the joker",mj,5,"the ballad of songbirds and snakesas most readers already know, this prequel explores coriolanus's life when he was a teenager. the opening chapters reveal that he was also chosen to be a mentor for lucy gray who was from the despised district 12.but what she lacks in fighting skills she makes up for being a charismatic performer. lucy gray learned how to work a situation to her advantage.in the beginning the tributes did not enjoy capitol luxuries but were kept in cages and barely fed. it‚Äôs a stark contrast to the future hunger games when tributes were met with an extravagant welcome and dined on rich foods.the problem was that watching too much brutality turned the capitol away from the games. snow's addition to the hunger games of costumes, interviews, and the underdog tributes made the propaganda go down easy. this should be a cautionary tale.a lot of readers are not getting the point the author is trying to make. in the opening of this book there's a quote by hobbes:‚Äúhereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man.‚Äù ‚Äî thomas hobbes, leviathan, 1651coriolanus's first ""lesson"" to be molded into the future oppressor was during the hunger games; when he was forced to go in the arena to get out sejanus, one of the mentors, who was not supposed to be in there. while at the hospital getting stitches, the head gamekeeper, dr. gaul, asked if coriolanus understood what he was supposed to learn.‚Äúwithout the threat of death, it wouldn‚Äôt have been much of a lesson,‚Äù said dr. gaul. ‚Äúwhat happened in the arena? that‚Äôs humanity undressed. the tributes. and you, too. how quickly civilization disappears. all your fine manners, education, family background, everything you pride yourself on, stripped away in the blink of an eye, revealing everything you actually are. a boy with a club who beats another boy to death. that‚Äôs mankind in its natural state.‚Äù‚Äúi think i wouldn‚Äôt have beaten anyone to death if you hadn‚Äôt stuck me in that arena!‚Äù he retorted.‚Äúyou can blame it on the circumstances, the environment, but you made the choices you made, no one else. it‚Äôs a lot to take in all at once, but it‚Äôs essential that you make an effort to answer that question. who are human beings? because who we are determines the type of governing we need. later on, i hope you can reflect and be honest with yourself about what you learned tonight.‚Äùa very similar thought process was also stated by the joker in the dark night:‚Äúto them, you‚Äôre just a freak, like me! they need you right now, but when they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll cast you out, like a leper! you see, their morals, their code, it‚Äôs a bad joke. dropped at the first sign of trouble. they‚Äôre only as good as the world allows them to be. i‚Äôll show you. when the chips are down, these‚Ä¶ these civilized people, they‚Äôll eat each other. see, i‚Äôm not a monster. i‚Äôm just ahead of the curve.‚Äùboth the joker and dr. gaul has distorted thinking. it's one thing to make a choice freely and it's quite another thing to be forced into one.human nature is such that coercive enforcement of rules is indispensable to protect the rights of all but there is a fine line between government rule and government oppression.later, as coriolanus's feelings toward lucy gray grew, he helped her to survive the games only to get caught and was sent to train with the peacekeepers in her district. sejanus joined him there soon after.sejanus was never one who was comfortable with the capital and its way of life. he got a plan to help the districts by providing the rebels with guns for their flight up north, out of panem.coriolanus found out about sejanus‚Äô plot. mayfair threatens to tell her father [the mayor] everything, which would implicate coriolanus and lucy gray despite them being only bystanders; he shot her.sejanus is charged with treason and hanged. and lucy gray baird is the main suspect in billy taupe [her ex rebel boyfriend] and mayfair‚Äôs deaths, as he left her for the mayor‚Äôs daughter.in desperation, lucy gray decides to join the rebels up north and coriolanus decides to go with her, thinking there's nothing left of his life once the murder weapons were found.but as they prepare to flee district 12, snow gets paranoid that lucy gray is betraying him. when they stop at a house near district 12‚Äôs lake, he discovers the rebels‚Äô store of the weapons. when lucy gray takes a long time to cut up some katniss plants, he convinces himself that she has abandoned him and went to turn him in.""what if they interrogated or even tortured her? the story would come out. she hadn't killed anyone. he had. his word against hers"".but even though snow searches for her, lucy gray was nowhere to be found.the three killings that snow did throughout the book contributed to his downward spiral and ptsd. coriolanus clubbed to death a tribute, bobbin, in the hunger games arena. he also shoots the mayor's daughter and also turns in his best friend, sejanus, for treason, resulting in his execution.lucy gray was the last straw for his sanity. back at the capital the reader sees snow's change to ""the dark side"".""sometimes he would remember a moment of sweetness and almost wish things had ended differently. but it would never have worked out between them, even if he‚Äôd stayed. they were simply too different. and he didn‚Äôt like love, the way it had made him feel stupid and vulnerable. if he ever married, he‚Äôd choose someone incapable of swaying his heart. someone he hated, even, so they could never manipulate him the way lucy gray had. never make him feel jealous. or weak. livia cardew would be perfect. he imagined the two of them, the president and his first lady, presiding over the hunger games a few years from now. he‚Äôd continue the games, of course, when he ruled panem. people would call him a tyrant, ironfisted and cruel. but at least he would ensure survival for survival‚Äôs sake, giving them a chance to evolve. what else could humanity hope for? really, it should thank him.""this happened to ted bundy as i believe one of the main reasons he became a serial killer was because his first love dumped him. if you were to get all his victims lined up together you would think they were all sisters and you will notice that they all look like his first girlfriend.rejection is a powerful force in a person's life if they are not stable. dr. gaul planted the seeds for that rejection to take root and grow.",25-07-2020,1338635174,6,87,15.79,4.6,suzanne collins,2020,"adventure, war, science fiction, romance, action, thriller",suzanne,collins,7,25,7,2020,Summer,3,Pozitif,Negatif,0
the ballad of songbirds and snakes (a hunger games novel) (the hunger games),a fantastic villain origin story,holly,5,"i adored the hunger games series. dystopian ya is not a normal genre for me, but this series is awesome and this prequel? a fantastic villain origin story.coriolanus snow is an ambitious 18-year-old student whose wealthy family barely survived the war. he is all about image and pretense, which often vie against his normal, human feelings. his parents are dead and he lives in a rundown apartment with his grandmother and cousin tigris.but, the 10th hunger games is to be the first one with mentors and coriolanus has been chosen to mentor the female tribute from district 12. while at first humiliated at not being given a more highly rated district, he quickly realizes that lucy gray is someone who could win and it's up to him to figure out how to help her do that. along the way, coriolanus learns about love and the dangers it can bring.as he works his way through the games, he also discovers who wields the power in the capitol, who controls the games and what he needs to do to rise up above the masses.the student mentors also have a say in how the games are run, and in a somewhat twisted sort of way, their professor gives assignments and in coriolanus' essays, we see how future games come about and evolve. as the mentors talk about the games and what is happening, we also see how they are not all unfeeling or unkind. they view their tributes as people and they can see how unfair the games really are. at the same time we see that those in the capitol are only concerned about their well being and that their losses are because of the rebels.the hunger games series is vibrant and colorful in its imagery. this book, however, was almost more black and gray in its imagery, what with the rubble of the arena and the capitol still trying to rebuild from the war. that made the contrast of lucy gray's colorful skirt and the snakes all the more striking.as with the rest of the series, we see the government oppression, we see the results of war and rebellion. we see society broken, but fighting and we see that even with survival, life isn't grand and colorful. but we also see that the human spirit is strong.no one likes who president snow becomes and i think writing about his story so that he gains the reader's sympathy is brilliant. the story isn't fast-paced, but it drew me in and kept me enthralled.",09-09-2023,1338635174,5,87,15.79,4.6,suzanne collins,2020,"adventure, war, science fiction, romance, action, thriller",suzanne,collins,7,9,9,2023,Autumn,3,N√∂tr,Pozitif,3

"a court of wings and ruin (a court of thorns and roses, 3)",three books review and a little spoilers,jhfreeborn,5,"these were some of the best books i‚Äôve read in a long time. sarah left nothing undone when it came to describing a world that doesn‚Äôt exist. her story was original in many ways and in others you could see how it was similar to many others of its genre. her characters were so engaging. you could feel there happiness, their pain, their conflict. i would recommend these books to everyone who loves fantasy. oh and the fight scenes although not throughly detailed was enough to draw you in and make you feel as though you were in the battle with them.i know there are two other books. number 4 is a very long epilogue so if you want to check up on feyre and rhys family, that‚Äôd be the book. book 5 is nesta‚Äôs book. i have not read that book and will be putting it off for awhile because in all honesty she was one of the only characters in the book i really did not like. having said that i‚Äôm sure book 5 is supposed to be somewhat of a book redeeming her but i‚Äôm a little upset that she gets a book and lucien doesn‚Äôt or azriel for that matter.they were the only two characters that had the saddest back ground and deserved a hea, not nesta she was a grade a b****. mor could be seen as another character that had a tragic back story and in need of an hea, but i don‚Äôt agree. i hate how she strings azriel along because she is a selfish coward, just like nesta, but not so much of a heartless b.if sarah does come out with books for these worthy males i hope she chooses a different female for them than elaine. lucien deserves someone who will love him the way feyre loves rhys. and elaine needs a male who‚Äôll love her the way rhys loves feyre. i cannot see elaine and lucien having that same connection as the two i mentioned. and azriel cannot love sweet elaine that way either cause he will always be tied in someway to mor. you can‚Äôt drop 400+ years of longing and insta fall for someone else, especially if she‚Äôs not his mate, which mor is. azriel will always put mor before elaine. when mor comes clean and finally lets azriel go he‚Äôll need time to heal and that would be a good time for someone, not in their circle, to help him through that. one could argue with time and the right setup elaine and lucien could make it work and be just as enthralled with each other as our power couple, but lucien has some soul searching to do. something rhys didn‚Äôt have to do. he was everything feyre needed.finally tamlin. some would put him in the same category as nesta and mor but i don‚Äôt. tamlin has a good heart. feyre broke that heart. did tamlin handle things wrong? yes but he could have been so much more hateful, and wasn‚Äôt. instead he came to there aid, saved feyre, spied for the alliance and even helped bring rhys back to life, because he absolutely loved feyre. his book would be an adventure for sure. the female would have to be fierce as well as soft and definitely more mature than feyre. she matured quite a bit after everything that happened under the mountain but tamlins and feyres love was built before that and had she been more mature she wouldn‚Äôt have fallen for him so easily she would have been more cautious and discerning. my heart broke a little for him. even if i am team rhys and feyre.just my two cents. enjoy reading these books!!",30-08-2023,1635575605,7,88,11.56,4.8,sarah j. maas,2017,fantasy,sarah,j. maas,1,30,8,2023,Summer,3,N√∂tr,Pozitif,6
"a court of wings and ruin (a court of thorns and roses, 3)",spoilers!,ryan harris,5,"i loved every moment in this book. i was worried that after a court of mist and fury that the rest of the series would not hold up. while acomaf is my favorite so far aowar definitely held it own.i love all the new characters that we got to meet in this book along with all the new relationships.i love the connection between all the high lords. we get to see a lot more of their history and the relationships that they all had prior to the current timeline.many secrets were reveled in this book... or more so truths that have not yet been told.mor and her secret that now only feyre knows. i love this direction for her but i also am sadden for the relationship i was hoping for, for her and azriel. i hope that in the future books we get to see more of their friendship. i hope they will both have new love interest in the future books.herion and lucian... father and son. i hope this is something that gets brought up again in the net book.the relationships that still have so much questioning and i cannot wait to see what happens.obviously my favorite is feyre and rhys. enough said.cassian and nesta. are they mates? not mate? what? i need more. i need to know! there is something more there and i cannot wait to read more to find out.amern and varian. i just need more of these two. i love the little bits that we got in this book.lucian and elain. we know they are mates. elain is still in love with her human ex fianc√© greyson. ew. i love how gentle and understanding lucian is and backs away when she needs him too.all the twist at the end!3 that got me the most!1. feyre, nesta and elain's father. i was in tears!

"a court of wings and ruin (a court of thorns and roses, 3)","the war has come, who will survive and who will lose everything? (spoilers)",alyshia,5,"o this is the climax of the series as far as i am concerned. this book gets a lot of hate, but it is honestly, my favorite book of the series.o overview: spoilers: i have never in my life had so many feelings about a man in my real life let alone in a book. i lost count how many times i closed this book and just shook the crap out of it because tamlin made me so mad. good lord man. this dang book had me so in my feelings about everything every single time i turned the page.o this is the climax of the night court story itself, the war with hybern and trying to save the fae lands and the courts. hybern makes a deal with tamlin and they bring the night court to his court and drag in feyre‚Äôs human sisters, forcing them into the cauldron to become made. but what they don‚Äôt know is that nesta, ever the fighter, took from the cauldron just as it was taking from her and her sister. which was when the human queens (part of the treaty) see that hybern promised immortality from the cauldron with the sisters as tests, run but something was taken from cauldron so it takes from the next one in the cauldron, therefore making the queens mad. war comes, nesta saves cassian twice, hybern kills the girls‚Äô father and elain stabs him but nesta has the killshot and removes his head, the girls‚Äô father shows up with an armada when drakon and myriam show up with boats named after the girls, the cauldron calls elain and they search for her. feyre and amren and varian find the cauldron but amren deceives feyre and dives into the cauldron, she becomes her true form and wipes out mostly everything in the war with fire. the cauldron explodes into three pieces and rhys and feyre save it by mending it back together because feyre remembers that all life comes from the cauldron, but when she comes back to reality, rhys is lying on the ground and not breathing. she begs the high lords to fix him like they did her, so they do and he comes back.o along the way, feyre faces fears that the bone carver told her about to free him to get him to fight with them against hybern, also faces bryaxis (the dark thing in the lowest level of the library where the priestesses work at the house of wind). rhys frees the weaver of the wood (bone carvers sister) to help as well. hybern kills the bone carver and the weaver of the wood and bryaxis is still missing at the end of the book.o there is just so freaking much that happens in this book and that is why it is my favorite. the weaving of stories is immaculate within this book. i know that quite a few people don‚Äôt like sarah j. mass‚Äô writing but i did for sure. i‚Äôm also new to the fae writing, etc. however, i did definitely like this one the best out of all of them and i would re-read it 2942359798 times if i could. the ending and beginning of stories throughout this is just one that i wish i could read for the first time again.",09-08-2023,1635575605,13,88,11.56,4.8,sarah j. maas,2017,fantasy,sarah,j. maas,1,9,8,2023,Summer,3,Negatif,Negatif,6
"a court of wings and ruin (a court of thorns and roses, 3)",i will try my best to make this spoiler-free because so much happens,velarisreads,5,"oh goodness. i will try my best to make this spoiler-free because so much happens!now, this book came to me on its release day (thank you, amazon). i started reading it almost immediately and then i had exams. this is why it took me so long to finish it. i would try to read it before work or before class, but i wouldn‚Äôt be fast enough.so, we know what happened in the second book. feyre went back to tamlin, but surprise! it‚Äôs just a little trick. she will find her way back to rhysand.duh, she does. that‚Äôs not really a spoiler.war is looming and she, as the high lady, must work with the night court and her mate, rhysand, in order to win this war and bring peace to all. literally.so, i want to write this review differently. we love these characters so much, so i am going to break it down by character. no spoilers will be revealed for the characters. i will be careful.new characters are introduced in this book, but i will be letting you know about the familiar characters.- feyre -so, the ending of the second book had us shook. for real. in the third book, feyre is truly a badass. she is not taking any of tamlin‚Äôs shit, let me tell you that. she is determined to find her way back to rhysand and, yes she does, as noted above. when they reunite, of course there is the love-making. they wouldn‚Äôt be mates if they didn‚Äôt get it on, you know? anyway...it‚Äôs a bit of an emotional reunion for feyre, seeing her friends and such. especially her sisters. we get a glimpse of them almost immediately, but i‚Äôll talk about them lately. throughout the book, feyre is now a high lady of the night court. she slowly learns how to control a room and she learns more about herself. this book really shows us how strong feyre really is.- rhysand -right now, rhysand is probably going through hell because he isn‚Äôt with feyre and he isn‚Äôt sure when she will be back. it gets kind of worse when feyre tries to get back to him. during that journey, their bond is silent. when they reunite, you get that giddy feeling reading their interactions again and i‚Äôm actually glad their separation doesn‚Äôt really last long. this is only if you ship them, though. in this book, i definitely got a sense of a struggle with rhysand. it‚Äôs almost as if the ending of the second book and its events really made him vulnerable and he is definitely scared of losing feyre and we learn more about his time with amarantha when he was her icky love slave or whatever. we learn more things, too. i like this side of him, this vulnerable side. there are moments during the impending war where he expresses his fear of losing his family. i‚Äôm going to say that there is a moment with rhysand where you stare at the book and you want to burst into tears. that‚Äôs all. no spoilers.- lucien -everybody wants lucien. they wanted more of lucien. i‚Äôm going to say, in my own opinion, that i was kind of disappointed in lucien‚Äôs part of the story. i feel like there was not enough of him. he seemed to be absent, physically, for over half of the book. before its release, i saw that people were excited to read more of lucien and his pov. but, i was disappointed that it was lacking. i think his story isn‚Äôt over yet, though. there didn‚Äôt seem to be any closure for him. hopefully, since this world continues, we will get more.- nesta -oh, nesta. i think she is a love/hate character. we get more of her in this book and she becomes more likable, though still frustrating. let‚Äôs just say the situation between her and cassian drags and it just makes you roll your eyes. not at sarah, of course. at nesta. she is so stubborn and it just annoyed me at times. however, with that aside, she definitely learns to become stronger and to accept herself as a fae, which i find important. i mean, she doesn‚Äôt have much of a choice. she still has the attitude in her, but she has her badass moments.- elain -oh, man, it was heartbreaking to read about elain and how she was handling things. i don‚Äôt know how else to describe it, really. it‚Äôs even worse when lucien tries to interact with her with hardly any progress. in this book, elain is stuck on grayson. i mean, we know that isn‚Äôt going to happen anymore. but, it‚Äôs just sad. again, with lucien, i don‚Äôt think her story is finished. there are some unanswered questions. on a happier note, elain learns to find her voice and her inner strength after what she went through. that made up for the rest of it.- cassian -oh, cassian. he is still a smartass. but, something is definitely up with him here. i‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs because of nesta and her ignorance of him. he tries to hide the fact it bothers him, but you can tell it really does. we also see cassian‚Äôs bond with rhysand and how strong it really is; their fear of losing each other in this war. cassian definitely wants to prove himself in this war and we see that, but some of the scenes were scary. not sinister or anything. but, as a reader, you are very scared and worried something bad will happen to him. i‚Äôll stop there, for your sake.i‚Äôm combining a few other characters together for one reason:- amren, azriel, mor, tamlin -why are these characters combined? well, let‚Äôs start with amren. we only see amren when she is helping nesta and her connection with the cauldron. there is a scene of betrayal, sort of. but, besides her amazing ending, she doesn‚Äôt feature that much.azriel is kind of the same. he felt too much like a background character for me and, though there are scenes where you pray for him as you keep reading, i wish he was featured more. i don‚Äôt think he got much closure either.which brings me to mor. oh man, we have a bombshell with her. i won‚Äôt reveal that, though. but, i wlll say her lack of closure goes with azriel.tamlin, tamlin. i hate him, but i kind of don‚Äôt after reading this book. he spends most of the time just being pissy about what feyre did, making innuendo jokes to get a rise, and just acting like a fifteen year old. however, there are moments where it seems he wants some kind of redemption or something. i will say that i do think he is still in love with feyre, but i think his story is at an end. the closure is definitely there and hopefully he will find his own happiness.i want to reiterate that these opinions are my own opinions and how i felt about the book.regardless of some of the negative opinions, i am still giving this book five stars. this book had me on edge and i‚Äôm glad but sad that this is the last full novel. unless the book gods and sarah want to bless us with another full novel that isn‚Äôt a novella or something. i‚Äôm still praying.if you haven‚Äôt read this book because you are scared, don‚Äôt let that stop you. i was scared the whole way and i kept reading. i am very happy with this book and i loved entering this world again. this will probably be a series that i will definitely reread. that doesn‚Äôt happen often.bottom line: you‚Äôll always be wanting more of feyre‚Äôs story.",30-05-2017,1635575605,13,88,11.56,4.8,sarah j. maas,2017,fantasy,sarah,j. maas,1,30,5,2017,Spring,2,Pozitif,Pozitif,0
"a court of wings and ruin (a court of thorns and roses, 3)",best read of 2017!,amazon customer,5,"‚Äúwhen you erupt, girl, make sure it is felt across worlds.‚Äùi seriously have no idea where to even begin with this review. i'm going to try not to include any spoilers, but if there are any, i'll give you fair warning before reading further. honestly, i am absolutely blown away by this novel and it took me several days to adjust to the world after finishing this beautiful book. i honestly don't know how sjm can top this book, but let's get real here...she will because she's just that amazing. i read this in one sitting overnight because i simply couldn't put it down. it's true, this book is a court of pain and feels but it is absolutely mindblowing and i felt incomplete after finishing. sjm seriously took her writing to new heights, and i can't even begin to explain how fantastic it was to experience this journey.‚Äúthe great joy and honour of my life has been to know you. to call you my family. and i am grateful - more than i can possibly say - that i was given this time with you all.‚Äùi have been such a fan of this series from the very beginning because i always felt that it showed sarah j. maas' extreme writing talent. it's so different from the throne of glass series, and i loved the creativity and dedication that she puts into this story. you can clearly tell just how much all of these characters mean to her, and every scene is richly described. her writing truly sweeps you away and it's something that you easily lose yourself in. i know that if someone would ask me tomorrow to leave this world behind and instead go into feyre's world, i would not even hesitate. this story is complex and i never expected for sjm to build on the world so much more than previously, but she does, and it's excellent. there is a great progression to the story, and this means new faces and new places come into play all while still developing our beloved characters.‚Äúwhat we think to be our greatest weakness can sometimes be our biggest strength.‚Äùthe book starts with feyre back in the spring court with tamlin. while some people might have found this part slow, i think it showcased just how far feyre has come as a character. the strength that it took to go back and set the foundation for her (and rhysand's) plot was utterly fantastic! i think it helped set up the story perfectly and it showed us feyre's mindset at the time. i definitely got some aelin feels in this part because of how awesome and kickass feyre was, which just added to my love for her character. but the best thing: feyre's characterization. i thought she was well-developed already, but sjm added yet another layer to her character. feyre is such a strong and powerful character and has come such a long way since the first book. looking back, i can't even believe that this is the same person...and that is an excellent thing. it shows how much rhys and the night court have impacted her and aided her in the person she was to ultimately become.‚Äúi would have waited five hundred more years for you. a thousand years. and if this was all the time we were allowed to have... the wait was worth it.‚Äùrhys is as perfect as ever. i mean come on...who doesn't love him?! the way he treats feyre made me swoon every darn time, and she is his high lady in every single way. he gives her something that tamlin never did...respect. he believes in her and that she can accomplish amazing thing. he allows her to spread her wings (<-- this is an excellent pun btw...i know i'm really not as funny as i think) and embrace her magic. the constant support and love rhys shows her is something every girl should have. plus, he's freaking hilarious...you can't get a better man! i honestly will never get enough of him and he will always stay firmly in my top 5 book boyfriends. obviously the chemistry between feyre and rhys is off the charts, and all the sex scenes are perfectly written. i love them together so much, it just makes my heart happy.‚Äúit's a rare person to face who they are and not run from it - not be broken by it.‚Äùcassian and nesta are brilliant and i firmly believe that they will be a focus in one of the upcoming books. i need them together, and i need to have a book with them as the main characters because it will be such an epic story! they have the perfect dynamic that is present throughout the entire book. we learn more about mor, and my heart broke for her multiple times. i just wanted to give her a giant hug, but i loved delving deeper into her character. azriel is brooding as ever, but i love him. there is definitely something up with him and elain, and i need to know what that something is. amren's sass is pure gold and i love her so much. there are definitely some surprises with her character that left me (along with the characters) shocked. we also meet a new high lord, helion and god do i love him! he has to be in these next 3 books because he's awesome. we also see the return of the bone carver and the suriel. and seriously...they play epic roles in the story. and tamlin...i have to mention this guy. i actually liked how sjm handled him in this book (especially at the end). it was realistic and believable. and (lord help me), i didn't hate him anymore.‚Äúmy rage had become a living thing inside my chest, an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to waking.‚Äùmy favorite part about this book though (besides all the other stuff) is its unpredictability. seriously, sjm gave me a heart attack multiple times. just when i thought the story was going in one direction and bombshell twist would come out of nowhere and completely change the entire story. and there was not 1, not 2, but 3 major things at the end in which i was freaking out and making very weird noises that i'm sure my neighbors in my apartment building did not appreciate. the one major (and i mean major) thing involving a certain character at the end had me with tears in my eyes and my face the picture of shock. i seriously have never been more scared for a character in my life, and i was praying so hard that sjm didn't do what she did. i think i stopped breathing at one point, so how dare you sarah j maas!! how dare you scare me like that!‚Äúit is a new world, and we must decide how we are to end this old one and begin it anew.‚Äùif you couldn't tell, i loved this book! i still am not okay after reading the entire battle since sjm made me lose my mind, but everything was tied up nicely and the conclusion was everything i could want. most of the main questions were answered, but she definitely planted the seeds for a new foe for our group to be facing. i think it would be interesting if the books were from different characters' perspectives, but i'm never going to mind more feyre and rhys. this is by far the best read of 2017, and you need to read it as soon as humanly possible!happy reading :)",14-05-2017,1635575605,4,88,11.56,4.8,sarah j. maas,2017,fantasy,sarah,j. maas,1,14,5,2017,Spring,2,Pozitif,Pozitif,0

""this is your choice feyre, we are a team, i will never take your choice away."" take that passive aggressiveness tamlin!! oh wait, nope, just the reader gets to take it, over and over and over....each and every time the author reminds us of feyre's choice!!!!!lets talk tamlin shall we. feyre did him dirty. i know i know, im sure im in the minority here. but it just aggravates me when the whole point of contention in books is boiled down to a simple lack of communication. and that really was all it was. she fell out of love, moved on, but no one really told tamlin! so he went under the wrong assumptions for so long. it really was aggravating. he was kind to her and truly loved her. sure, he eventually said some terrible things to her. but a man scorned he was!! and really, if she was simply more upfront with him than her lousy letter, 'i wish you well' or something dumb like that, i wouldnt be all up in arms about it!the book is long. very long. and yet we get nothing of lucian and his new mate. like nothing. they still have only had maybe 2 whole sentences between each other by the end of this 700+ page book. so i have no idea if they are even covered in the other books.now dont think i forgot nesta. ugh i wish i would. shes a raging b, pretty much 99% of the book. it gets old real fast. yet she's written like a hero to save their day! she's written essentially: oh, she has problems with dealing with things and expressing her emotions well, so it's ok she treats everyone else like trash. she has an excuse. ....i hate that shiz. just because you are sad or mad or hurting, does not give you the right to hurt others. nesta says to feyre, 'why didnt you tell us you couldnt read, i did not now and would have helped you.' yeah, sure b. you treated feyre like a sack of doo doo, and never truly worried about her when she was dangerously hunting for the family, or freezing to death or whatever other sacrifices feyre made while you never.once.said.thanks! so no, nesta gets no free pass from me. she never once redeemed herself in this book and i am only sorry cassian is stuck with her frozen hearted soul.the whole mor and azrial thing. sad. like why make us think one thing, only to make it sooo much less fulfilling. i loved azrial, and his soft spoken, loyal soul. only to have to deal with whatever the heck mor has going on. talk about stringing someone along for.....zillions of years.just disappointed with this book. when i invested so much time, i expected a bit more i suppose. don't get me wrong. there were good parts. but for me, the bad parts made this book a 2.5 star read for me.",12-09-2023,1635575605,9,88,11.56,4.8,sarah j. maas,2017,fantasy,sarah,j. maas,1,12,9,2023,Autumn,3,Negatif,Pozitif,6

"a court of wings and ruin (a court of thorns and roses, 3)",fast paced and addictive,melissa mitchell,5,"(5/5‚≠êÔ∏è) ‚Äúmy rage had become a living thing inside my chest, an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to waking.‚Äù ‚Äîsarah j maasfeyre is ready to fight in this final installment of the acotar trilogy (not counting the novella). having failed to damage the cauldron in acomaf, feyre is taken into the spring court under the guise of having been brainwashed. tamlin believes her leaving him was all rhysand‚Äôs doing. she encourages this misbelief, determined to rip apart tamlin‚Äôs court from the inside. meanwhile, the king of hybern is done staging his troops for war. he‚Äôs ready to bring prythian to its knees. he plans to strike hard at the wall, then sweep across the land and take all the courts. the only way to stop him is to unite all the high lords, and even then it might not be enough. it will take something short of a miracle to bring him down. but the world has some unexpected allies in the form of monsters. it also has feyre, amren, nesta and elain. these strong women are unlike others for more than one reason, but especially because they are ‚Äúmade.‚Äù they just might have what it takes to save everyone, even if it kills them.crying!!!! i‚Äôm crying. or i was. i don‚Äôt remember the last time i cried so much in a book. happy tears. sad tears. sometimes i was just crying because of how emotional this book made me. like rhysand‚Äôs little circle up before the final battle (which reminded me a lot of the final battle in lotr btw). rhysand‚Äôs words to all his friends. this might be the last time they are all together. that was all i could think as tears washed down my face. as a sense of foreboding and fear settled over me. deep down i was thinking, sjm wouldn‚Äôt dare kill any of them...right?!...right?!‚Äúi believe everything happens for a reason. whether it is decided by the mother, or the cauldron, or some sort of tapestry of fate, i don't know. i don't really care. but i am grateful for it, whatever it is. grateful that it brought you all into my life. if it hadn't... i might have become as awful as that prick we're going to face today.‚Äùthe plot in this book was faster paced than acomaf. a lot faster. everything happens in rapid succession. there‚Äôs no time to catch your breath. feyre is in spring court for the first part, bringing it down, and then running for her life, and there‚Äôs the meeting of the high lords‚Äîwhich was omg, tense‚Äîand the attack at the library, all the battles. you get the picture. it‚Äôs go go go.in terms of world building, sjm really tied things off nicely. i loved her introduction of some of the monsters, giving us an even deeper glimpse into prythian. like the use of the weaver, the bone carver, and the creature from the depths of the library for the war. we got to see all the high lords together. we got to see more magic. everything was brought to a nice close in that regard.there was still plenty of romance, and hints of new romance to come, like cassian and nesta (so excited for their upcoming novella), and elain and lucian...? if that ever happens.‚Äúnesta looked at the king with death twining around his hands, then down at cassian. and covered cassian‚Äôs body with her own. cassian went still - then his hand slid over her back. together. they‚Äôd go together.‚Äùi really liked the way rhysand and feyre‚Äôs relationship strengthened, too. that he trusted her with things as dangerous as sneaking in to the king of hybern‚Äôs camp to rescue her sister spoke volumes:‚Äúyou do not fear. you do not falter. you do not yield. you go in, you get her, and you come out again.‚Äùwow. that quote though. those two are my favorite bookish couple of all time. hands down. he could have insisted on doing it himself. or even sending someone else. but he trusted feyre because she was confident that she could succeed.in terms of character development, where the last book was feyre healing, i felt this book was her coming into her own. she really learned how to take matters into her own hands, how to be strong, how to make her own decisions. she definitely did some growing, with rhysand‚Äôs encouragement no less. she looked into the mirror and saw who she really was, and she accepted that.the other character arc that stood out to me was tamlin‚Äôs, even though it happened mostly in the background. he went from feeling he owned feyre, to finally accepting that she wasn‚Äôt his, but even more: he saved her life. that, in my eyes, fully redeemed him. i still find fault with him, and he‚Äôs not my favorite, but he saved her life.the ending was a little surprising but very satisfying for me. i really didn‚Äôt expect amarin to come back, but she did and i‚Äôm happier for it. i liked that she came back changed. and...rhysand dying? that was...i‚Äôm not sure. at first i thought it was unnecessary, but the more i think about it, i think it was necessary because we needed tamlin to be the final say in the matter. we needed that final acorn of life from him. we needed to see that tamlin had finally accepted feyre‚Äôs choice. that he would rather see feyre happy, even if it meant he couldn‚Äôt have her. that, to me, tied off his character arc nicely.this series has become my absolute favorite. i say that about a lot of books, but there‚Äôs no question here. i recommend it to everyone who loves darker fantasy, political intrigue, strong female leads, sexy fae...you name it! i am glad there are two novellas for me to read soon. one i have and will get to soon, the other coming in january (yesss). so...go read this series!",22-07-2020,1635575605,4,88,11.56,4.8,sarah j. maas,2017,fantasy,sarah,j. maas,1,22,7,2020,Summer,3,N√∂tr,Pozitif,3
"a court of wings and ruin (a court of thorns and roses, 3)",the story and writing are superb,alexandria woods,5,"*****spoilers*****a fantastic written work! i am a sucker for happy endings, well mostly a happy ending anyway, at least in this book. feyre and rhys and crew jetting off constantly to face danger and war and try to make their world a better place. they accomplished much and have the makings for the peace and unity they crave so hopefully things will go well if there's another book to this series.i did not like feyre's plan or execution of her plan to deceive tamlin. faking her feelings to get out from under hybern was prudent in the moment but when she went back to the spring court and sowed discontent and disrupted the trust tamlin's court had in him, i was let down. especially since tamlin's actions at the time were in an attempt to save feyre, misguided though his goals were. i'd have much preferred if feyre disappeared from spring again after talking to tamlin. too, i never really bought into feyre's hatred of tamlin. yes he stifled her and locked her in his house with wards up and it was devastating after her stay under the mountain but it wasn't so egregious in my opinion to garner such strong dislike from feyre. tamlin loses her and lucian from his court at the same time in a nest of king hybern's goals. it's just that much sadder to find that tamlin was trying to fight against the king through the keeping his enemies close adage. and he comes through for her in the end when she and azriel go to that enemy camp to save her sister elain. my hope would be that tamlin finds himself a mate down the line, he's been battered enough, i think.rhys. oh rhys. i liked him under the mountain when he was bad but knowing the truth behind the mask is perfect too. he makes mistakes but his heart is in the right place and his selflessness and attempts to shield others so takes more on himself in sacrifice of everything he has and is breaks me when he dies putting it into repairing the cauldron. thankfully the other high lords survive the battlefield and give them his essence plus fayre so that he's resurrected. i wouldn't have liked the outcome had he remained dead but it does make me wonder if it would work for all of the other high lords? and what that knowledge will mean in future for the courts.thank you for finally revealing the story behind mor's inability to love azriel the way he desires. the next step is for her to actually tell him that she prefers women. i like azriel the best and he should hear what she says so that he can move on fully, i think. i also want mor to be happy with whoever she chooses without fear of what others think. it's curious though that mor has her sexuality hanging over her head when one of the high lords has a same sex mate. makes no sense.cassian and nesta have the beginnings of something, if she'll allow it. the care is evident between them but after the final battle, she seemed to withdraw instead of move forward on what they were building together. her desperate cries for him on the battlefield saved his life so i'd think she'd be loathe to waste more time.amsen was a surprise. i didn't realize what she was doing when she slammed the book shut just after fayre touched the cauldron but no way did i ever think amsen was a traitor. tricks up her sleeve she had but my thought was that she and nesta had figured it out and nesta would have to be the sacrifice, especially since nesta was the most connected to the cauldron. amsen sacrificed herself but again, she was brought back by rhys. no longer otherworldly, just high fae but she's there in the end and hopefully can build something with varian.lucian has almost no role in this book which i thought was disappointing but it was cute seeing his reactions to and around elain. he's so careful and considerate and clearly wants the bond but is being patient. wish them both happiness in whatever future they have but i think it'll be a while for elain. she's still clearly devastated by her mortal mate greyson's reaction to her fae transformation. it was incongruous that the gentle son (as previously portrayed) was more harsh and unforgiving than his father (who had been portrayed as just that intolerant of fae). elain is almost child-like in this book and doesn't interact much with everyone else. i forgot about her until the cauldron snatched her away. that she was the one who stabbed king haybern wasn't a surprise to me but given her nature to that point, i'm glad she seemed to take something of herself back.outside of rhys, my favorite high lord was helion. can't put a finger on exactly why but maybe because i sense he needs something more to his life. that he's probably lucian's father was a revelation that was a shock but i wished feyre or someone had told them both. lucian's mother loves helion but is married to baron whom his son eris is plotting to kill. i'm not sure what that would then mean for his mother and helion but only time will tell if there are more books written.",10-09-2020,1635575605,6,88,11.56,4.8,sarah j. maas,2017,fantasy,sarah,j. maas,1,10,9,2020,Autumn,3,Pozitif,Pozitif,3

the coworker,a great twisty psychological thriller!,sharon,4,"i love freida mcfadden‚Äôs writing; she always keeps me guessing. and her newest book, the coworker, is no exception.natalie farrell is a sales representative and dawn schiff is an accountant at vixed, a nutritional supplement company. natalie is beautiful and popular, and everything seems to come so easily for her. dawn is the complete opposite, she is socially awkward, plain looking and her only real friend is her childhood best friend, mia. they do have one thing in common though, they both have dark secrets. when dawn goes missing, natalie finds herself in the middle and her perfect life is blown apart.dawn is always at her desk at 8:45am sharp. so, when natalie showed up to work at 9:00 and dawn was not at her desk, she stopped and did a double take. where is dawn? she is always on time and has never taken a sick day. no one else in the office is all that concerned that dawn is not in, but natalie cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong. when the phone on dawn‚Äôs desk rings, natalie answers it and the voice on the other end sounds like dawn and she whispers, ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù. natalie takes it upon herself to drive to dawn‚Äôs house and check on her. when she enters dawn‚Äôs house through the unlocked back door, natalie is shocked by what she sees. dawn‚Äôs living room is covered in blood, but dawn is nowhere to be found. when the police start their investigation, they uncover information that makes them set their sights on natalie. natalie is now in a cat and mouse game, and she must find out what happened to dawn and why someone is framing her.i cannot say too much about what happens because i think it is best to go into this book blind. but i will say i wasn‚Äôt sure who to believe or trust while i was reading. at first, i liked natalie because she came across as such a nice person. every year she has a charity 5k run event to help raise funds for muscular dystrophy, in honor of her friend she lost to the disease. natalie also always seemed to go out of her way to be nice to dawn, though they were not best friends, natalie considered dawn to be a friend. but then we get dawn‚Äôs pov via emails she sent to her childhood best friend, mia. in these emails natalie comes across as a very different person, according to dawn, natalie was a bully. i loved getting these two sides because it made both natalie and dawn unreliable characters.the coworker was full of so many twists and turns. just when i thought i may know what was going on, a twist would come and point me in another direction. so many times i found my jaw drop and would be like ‚Äòwhat?!‚Äù. if you are looking for a twisty psychological thriller, then i definitely recommend freida mcfadden‚Äôs the coworker.",22-10-2023,172829620x,5,92,9.44,4.2,freida mcfadden,2023,"thriller, mystery",freida,mcfadden,2,22,10,2023,Autumn,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,0
the coworker,devious and deadly drama,susan m. baumann,4,"this is the second of mcfadden‚Äôs books that i‚Äôve read. mcfadden does create significant suspense in this story, and i wanted to find out how it would end. i figured out a portion of the plot beforehand, but was still anxious to see what would happen next.natalie and dawn are polar opposites. natalie is blonde, vivacious, extroverted and successful.she‚Äôs a hard-charging sales rep for a boston-based health supplement company. she‚Äôs well-liked, motivated and used to getting what she wants.in contrast, dawn is quiet, reserved, shy and more-than-a-little quirky. she‚Äôs rigidly punctual, socially awkward and desperately eager to connect with her coworkers, often with disastrous results. she‚Äôs a dedicated accountant at the same company as natalie, but she exists in the background and on the sidelines.then one day, dawn doesn‚Äôt show up for work.this wouldn‚Äôt be particularly unusual for a typical employee, but it‚Äôs definitely out of character for dawn, whose schedule is consistent and unwavering. while out on a sales call, natalie impulsively decides to go to dawn‚Äôs home to check on her, and to see if anything is amiss. natalie enters through an unlocked back door and finds a large bloodstain on the living room carpet. shaken, she calls the police.an investigation begins that centers around dawn‚Äôs various colleagues because she seemed to have few friends and little family.the assigned detective pursues various leads, but increasingly circles back to natalie and her possible involvement. natalie‚Äôs puzzled and then fearful when she becomes the central focus and primary suspect in the investigation, when the battered body of an unidentified woman is found.the story moves between the search for dawn and natalie‚Äôs racheting alarm at the mounting evidence against her. she worries that someone is trying to frame her for murder, and watches helplessly as former friends turn against her. mcfadden does an excellent job at depicting the juxtaposition of the two women‚Äôs lives as they intersect and unravel. lots of adrenaline and pages turning in a flurry. i was surprised by how invested i was, given my earlier reaction to mcfadden‚Äôs other book, ‚Äúnever lie‚Äù. this one had a slightly more redemptive message, though the darker undertones are still ever-present in this book as well. mcfadden seems to favor shady characters with sinister edges, complicated backstories and subjective motivations. as a thriller, it works, but i wouldn‚Äôt want to encounter people like this in real life.",20-09-2023,172829620x,4,92,9.44,4.2,freida mcfadden,2023,"thriller, mystery",freida,mcfadden,2,20,9,2023,Autumn,3,N√∂tr,Negatif,0

hatchet,wisdom in the wilderness,la in dallas,5,"i read hatchet for the first time many years ago -- probably 1988, when it became a newbery honor book. not all newbery books are great, but this one was. being reminded of it recently, i noticed that it is the first book of a series of five, most of which i have never read, so i decided to go back to it.hatchet is the story of thirteen-year-old brian robeson. brian sets off as a passenger in a single-engine bush plane to visit his father in northern canada. on the way, the pilot dies in a heart attack. brian, whom the pilot had been showing how to fly the plane before his heart attack, manages to crash the plane in a lake in the forest. he survives the crash, but then has the problem of surviving until he is rescued. he does survive (not a spoiler, since the publisher's blurb tells us that this is a ""story of survival"").you would naturally imagine this to be an action-packed story, but it really is not. there are a few exciting moments, most conspicuously the crash and the tornado (also mentioned in the blurb). it is mostly about brian figuring out how to survive -- how to feed himself and remain safe from danger. and survival, it turns out, depends on wisdom. brian learns to see the wild world he inhabits and to know its meanings. i am tempted to say that brian becomes wise, but i think that's unfair to him. brian was wise, but his wisdom needed to be brought to the fore.in an epilog, gary paulsen tells us that brian is forever changed by this experience.""when the pilot rescued brian he had been alone on the l-shaped lake for fifty-four days. during that time he had lost seventeen percent of his body weight. he later gained back six percent, but had virtually no body fat‚Äîhis body had consumed all extra weight and he would remain lean and wiry for several years.""many of the changes would prove to be permanent. brian had gained immensely in his ability to observe what was happening and react to it; that would last him all his life. he had become more thoughtful as well, and from that time on he would think slowly about something before speaking.""when i read that, i felt oddly envious. i caught myself wishing that something like this could happen to me. of course, i don't really. i don't want to be trapped in the forests of northern ontario for 8 weeks all on my own. i'm happy here with my books and movies and grocery stores and microwave oven. but, let us just say, hatchet shows me something of what those cost me.hatchet is brief -- about a two-hour read. and yes, there is indeed a hatchet involved. the story has a real feeling of authenticity.",21-12-2022,1416936475,4,97,5.14,4.7,gary paulsen,1987," young adult novel, adventure novel, survival story",gary,paulsen,8,21,12,2022,Winter,4,Pozitif,Pozitif,35
